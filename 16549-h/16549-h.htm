<div class="blockquot"><p>"Venice, April 9. 1817.</p>

<p>"Your letters of the 18th and 20th are arrived. In my own I have
given you the rise, progress, decline, and fall, of my recent
malady. It is gone to the devil: I won't pay him so bad a
compliment as to say it came from him;&mdash;he is too much of a
gentleman. It was nothing but a slow fever, which quickened its
pace towards the end of its journey. I had been bored with it some
weeks&mdash;with nocturnal burnings and morning perspirations; but I am
quite well again, which I attribute to having had neither medicine
nor doctor thereof.</p>

<p>"In a few days I set off for Rome: such is my purpose. I shall
change it very often before Monday next, but do you continue to
direct and address to <i>Venice</i>, as heretofore. If I go, letters
will be forwarded: I say '<i>if</i>,' because I never know what I shall
do till it is done; and as I mean most firmly to<span class="pagenum"><a id="page2" name="page2"></a>Pg 2</span> set out for Rome,
it is not unlikely I may find myself at St. Petersburg.</p>

<p>"You tell me to 'take care of myself;'&mdash;faith, and I will. I won't
be posthumous yet, if I can help it. Notwithstanding, only think
what a 'Life and Adventures,' while I am in full scandal, would be
worth, together with the 'membra' of my writing-desk, the sixteen
beginnings of poems never to be finished! Do you think I would not
have shot myself last year, had I not luckily recollected that Mrs.
C * * and Lady N * *, and all the old women in England would have
been delighted;&mdash;besides the agreeable 'Lunacy,' of the 'Crowner's
Quest,' and the regrets of two or three or half a dozen? Be assured
that I <i>would live</i> for two reasons, or more;&mdash;there are one or two
people whom I have to put out of the world, and as many into it,
before I can 'depart in peace;' if I do so before, I have not
fulfilled my mission. Besides, when I turn thirty, I will turn
devout; I feel a great vocation that way in Catholic churches, and
when I hear the organ.</p>

<p>"So * * is writing again! Is there no Bedlam in Scotland? nor
thumb-screw? nor gag? nor hand-cuff? I went upon my knees to him
almost, some years ago, to prevent him from publishing a political
pamphlet, which would have given him a livelier idea of 'Habeas
Corpus' than the world will derive from his present production upon
that suspended subject, which will doubtless be followed by the
suspension of other of his Majesty's subjects.</p>

<p>"I condole with Drury Lane and rejoice with * *,&mdash;<span class="pagenum"><a id="page3" name="page3"></a>Pg 3</span>that is, in a
modest way,&mdash;on the tragical end of the new tragedy.</p>

<p>"You and Leigh Hunt have quarrelled then, it seems? I introduce him
and his poem to you, in the hope that (malgr&eacute; politics) the union
would be beneficial to both, and the end is eternal enmity; and yet
I did this with the best intentions: I introduce * * *, and * * *
runs away with your money: my friend Hobhouse quarrels, too, with
the Quarterly: and (except the last) I am the innocent Istmhus
(damn the word! I can't spell it, though I have crossed that of
Corinth a dozen times) of these enmities.</p>

<p>"I will tell you something about Chillon.&mdash;A Mr. <i>De Luc</i>, ninety
years old, a Swiss, had it read to him, and is pleased with it,&mdash;so
my sister writes. He said that he was <i>with Rousseau</i> at <i>Chillon</i>,
and that the description is perfectly correct. But this is not all:
I recollected something of the name, and find the following passage
in 'The Confessions,' vol. iii. page 247. liv. viii.:&mdash;</p>

<p>"'De tous ces amusemens celui qui me pl&ucirc;t davantage fut une
promenade autour du Lac, que je fis en bateau avec <i>De Luc</i> p&egrave;re,
sa bru, ses <i>deux fils</i>, et ma Ther&eacute;se. Nous mimes sept jours &agrave;
cette tourn&eacute;e par le plus beau temps du monde. J'en gardai le vif
souvenir des sites qui m'avoient frapp&eacute; &agrave; l'autre extr&eacute;mit&eacute; du Lac,
et dont je fis la description, quelques ann&eacute;es apr&egrave;s, dans la
Nouvelle Heloise'</p>

<p>"This nonagenarian, De Luc, must be one of the 'deux fils.' He is
in England&mdash;infirm, but still in<span class="pagenum"><a id="page4" name="page4"></a>Pg 4</span> faculty. It is odd that he should
have lived so long, and not wanting in oddness that he should have
made this voyage with Jean Jacques, and afterwards, at such an
interval, read a poem by an Englishman (who had made precisely the
same circumnavigation) upon the same scenery.</p>

<p>"As for 'Manfred,' it is of no use sending <i>proofs</i>; nothing of
that kind comes. I sent the whole at different times. The two first
Acts are the best; the third so so; but I was blown with the first
and second heats. You must call it 'a Poem,' for it is <i>no Drama</i>,
and I do not choose to have it called by so * * a name&mdash;a 'Poem in
dialogue,' or&mdash;Pantomime, if you will; any thing but a green-room
synonyme; and this is your motto&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i4">"'There are more things in heaven and earth, Horatio,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Than are dreamt of in your philosophy.'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>"Yours ever, &amp;c.</p>

<p>"My love and thanks to Mr. Gifford."</p></div>

<p><b>LETTER 273. TO MR. MOORE.</b></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Venice, April 11. 1817.</p>

<p>"I shall continue to write to you while the fit is on me, by way of
penance upon you for your former complaints of long silence. I dare
say you would blush, if you could, for not answering. Next week I
set out for Rome. Having seen Constantinople, I should like to look
at t'other fellow. Besides, I want to see the Pope, and shall take
care to tell him that I vote for the Catholics and no Veto.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page5" name="page5"></a>Pg 5</span></p>

<p>"I sha'n't go to Naples. It is but the second best sea-view, and I
have seen the first and third, viz. Constantinople and Lisbon, (by
the way, the last is but a river-view; however, they reckon it
after Stamboul and Naples, and before Genoa,) and Vesuvius is
silent, and I have passed by &AElig;tna. So I shall e'en return to Venice
in July; and if you write, I pray you to address to Venice, which
is my head, or rather my <i>heart</i>, quarters.</p>

<p>"My late physician, Dr. Polidori, is here on his way to England,
with the present Lord G * * and the widow of the late earl. Dr.
Polidori has, just now, no more patients, because his patients are
no more. He had lately three, who are now all dead&mdash;one embalmed.
Horner and a child of Thomas Hope's are interred at Pisa and Rome.
Lord G * * died of an inflammation of the bowels: so they took them
out, and sent them (on account of their discrepancies), separately
from the carcass, to England. Conceive a man going one way, and his
intestines another, and his immortal soul a third!&mdash;was there ever
such a distribution? One certainly has a soul; but how it came to
allow itself to be enclosed in a body is more than I can imagine. I
only know if once mine gets out, I'll have a bit of a tussle before
I let it get in again to that or any other.</p>

<p>"And so poor dear Mr. Maturin's second tragedy has been neglected
by the discerning public! * * will be d&mdash;&mdash;d glad of this, and
d&mdash;&mdash;d without being glad, if ever his own plays come upon 'any
stage.'</p>

<p>"I wrote to Rogers the other day, with a message for you. I hope
that he flourishes. He is the<span class="pagenum"><a id="page6" name="page6"></a>Pg 6</span> Tithonus of poetry&mdash;immortal
already. You and I must wait for it.</p>

<p>"I hear nothing&mdash;know nothing. You may easily suppose that the
English don't seek me, and I avoid them. To be sure, there are but
few or none here, save passengers. Florence and Naples are their
Margate and Ramsgate, and much the same sort of company too, by all
accounts, which hurts us among the Italians.</p>

<p>"I want to hear of Lalla Rookh&mdash;are you out? Death and fiends! why
don't you tell me where you are, what you are, and how you are? I
shall go to Bologna by Ferrara, instead of Mantua: because I would
rather see the cell where they caged Tasso, and where he became mad
and * *, than his own MSS. at Modena, or the Mantuan birthplace of
that harmonious plagiary and miserable flatterer, whose cursed
hexameters were drilled into me at Harrow. I saw Verona and Vicenza
on my way here&mdash;Padua too.</p>

<p>"I go alone,&mdash;but alone, because I mean to return here. I only want
to see Rome. I have not the least curiosity about Florence, though
I must see it for the sake of the Venus, &amp;c. &amp;c.; and I wish also
to see the Fall of Terni. I think to return to Venice by Ravenna
and Rimini, of both of which I mean to take notes for Leigh Hunt,
who will be glad to hear of the scenery of his Poem. There was a
devil of a review of him in the Quarterly, a year ago, which he
answered. All answers are imprudent: but, to be sure, poetical
flesh and blood must have the last word&mdash;that's certain. I
thought,<span class="pagenum"><a id="page7" name="page7"></a>Pg 7</span> and think, very highly of his Poem; but I warned him of
the row his favourite antique phraseology would bring him into.</p>

<p>"You have taken a house at Hornsey: I had much rather you had taken
one in the Apennines. If you think of coming out for a summer, or
so, tell me, that I may be upon the hover for you.</p>

<p>"Ever," &amp;c.</p></div>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p><b>LETTER 274. TO MR. MURRAY.</b></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Venice, April 14. 1817.</p>

<p>"By the favour of Dr. Polidori, who is here on his way to England
with the present Lord G * *, (the late earl having gone to England
by another road, accompanied by his bowels in a separate coffer,) I
remit to you, to deliver to Mrs. Leigh, <i>two miniatures</i>;
previously you will have the goodness to desire Mr. Love (as a
peace-offering between him and me) to set them in plain gold, with
my arms complete, and 'Painted by Prepiani&mdash;Venice, 1817,' on the
back. I wish also that you would desire Holmes to make a copy of
<i>each</i>&mdash;that is, both&mdash;for myself, and that you will retain the
said copies till my return. One was done while I was very unwell;
the other in my health, which may account for their dissimilitude.
I trust that they will reach their destination in safety.</p>

<p>"I recommend the Doctor to your good offices with your government
friends; and if you can be of any use to him in a literary point of
view, pray be so.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page8" name="page8"></a>Pg 8</span></p>

<p>"To-day, or rather yesterday, for it is past midnight, I have been
up to the battlements of the highest tower in Venice, and seen it
and its view, in all the glory of a clear Italian sky. I also went
over the Manfrini Palace, famous for its pictures. Amongst them,
there is a portrait of <i>Ariosto</i> by <i>Titian</i>, surpassing all my
anticipation of the power of painting or human expression: it is
the poetry of portrait, and the portrait of poetry. There was also
one of some learned lady, centuries old, whose name I forget, but
whose features must always be remembered. I never saw greater
beauty, or sweetness, or wisdom:&mdash;it is the kind of face to go mad
for, because it cannot walk out of its frame. There is also a
famous dead Christ and live Apostles, for which Buonaparte offered
in vain five thousand louis; and of which, though it is a capo
d'opera of Titian, as I am no connoisseur, I say little, and
thought less, except of one figure in it. There are ten thousand
others, and some very fine Giorgiones amongst them, &amp;c. &amp;c. There
is an original Laura and Petrarch, very hideous both. Petrarch has
not only the dress, but the features and air of an old woman, and
Laura looks by no means like a young one, or a pretty one. What
struck me most in the general collection was the extreme
resemblance of the style of the female faces in the mass of
pictures, so many centuries or generations old, to those you see
and meet every day among the existing Italians. The queen of Cyprus
and Giorgione's wife, particularly the latter, are Venetians as it
were of yesterday;<span class="pagenum"><a id="page9" name="page9"></a>Pg 9</span> the same eyes and expression, and, to my mind,
there is none finer.</p>

<p>"You must recollect, however, that I know nothing of painting; and
that I detest it, unless it reminds me of something I have seen, or
think it possible to see, for which reason I spit upon and abhor
all the Saints and subjects of one half the impostures I see in the
churches and palaces; and when in Flanders, I never was so
disgusted in my life, as with Rubens and his eternal wives and
infernal glare of colours, as they appeared to me; and in Spain I
did not think much of Murillo and Velasquez. Depend upon it, of all
the arts, it is the most artificial and unnatural, and that by
which the nonsense of mankind is most imposed upon. I never yet saw
the picture or the statue which came a league within my conception
or expectation; but I have seen many mountains, and seas, and
rivers, and views, and two or three women, who went as far beyond
it,&mdash;besides some horses; and a lion (at Veli Pacha's) in the
Morea; and a tiger at supper in Exeter Change.</p>

<p>"When you write, continue to address to me at <i>Venice</i>. Where do
you suppose the books you sent to me are? At <i>Turin</i>! This comes of
'<i>the Foreign Office</i>' which is foreign enough, God knows, for any
good it can be of to me, or any one else, and be d&mdash;&mdash;d to it, to
its last clerk and first charlatan, Castlereagh.</p>

<p>"This makes my hundredth letter at least.</p>

<p>"Yours," &amp;c.</p></div><p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page10" name="page10"></a>Pg 10</span></p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p><b>TO MR. MURRAY.</b></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Venice, April 14. 1817.</p>

<p>"The present proofs (of the whole) begin only at the 17th page; but
as I had corrected and sent back the first Act, it does not
signify.</p>

<p>"The third Act is certainly d&mdash;&mdash;d bad, and, like the Archbishop of
Grenada's homily (which savoured of the palsy), has the dregs of my
fever, during which it was written. It must on <i>no account</i> be
published in its present state. I will try and reform it, or
rewrite it altogether; but the impulse is gone, and I have no
chance of making any thing out of it. I would not have it published
as it is on any account. The speech of Manfred to the Sun is the
only part of this act I thought good myself; the rest is certainly
as bad as bad can be, and I wonder what the devil possessed me.</p>

<p>"I am very glad indeed that you sent me Mr. Gifford's opinion
without <i>deduction</i>. Do you suppose me such a booby as not to be
very much obliged to him? or that in fact I was not, and am not,
convinced and convicted in my conscience of this same overt act of
nonsense?</p>

<p>"I shall try at it again: in the mean time, lay it upon the shelf
(the whole Drama, I mean): but pray correct your copies of the
first and second Acts from the original MS.</p>

<p>"I am not coming to England; but going to Rome in a few days. I
return to Venice in <i>June</i>; so, pray, address all letters, &amp;c. to
me <i>here</i>, as usual, that is, to <i>Venice</i>. Dr. Polidori this day
left this city with<span class="pagenum"><a id="page11" name="page11"></a>Pg 11</span> Lord G * * for England. He is charged with
some books to your care (from me), and two miniatures also to the
same address, <i>both</i> for my sister.</p>

<p>"Recollect not to publish, upon pain of I know not what, until I
have tried again at the third Act. I am not sure that I <i>shall</i>
try, and still less that I shall succeed, if I do; but I am very
sure, that (as it is) it is unfit for publication or perusal; and
unless I can make it out to my own satisfaction, I won't have any
part published.</p>

<p>"I write in haste, and after having lately written very often.
Yours," &amp;c.</p></div>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p><b>LETTER 276. TO MR. MURRAY.</b></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Foligno, April 26. 1817.</p>

<p>"I wrote to you the other day from Florence, inclosing a MS.
entitled 'The Lament of Tasso.' It was written in consequence of my
having been lately at Ferrara. In the last section of this MS. <i>but
one</i> (that is, the penultimate), I think that I have omitted a line
in the copy sent to you from Florence, viz. after the line&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i4">"And woo compassion to a blighted name,<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>insert,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i4">"Sealing the sentence which my foes proclaim.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The <i>context</i> will show you <i>the sense</i>, which is not clear in this
quotation. <i>Remember, I write this in the supposition that you have
received my Florentine packet.</i></p><p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page12" name="page12"></a>Pg 12</span></p>

<p>"At Florence I remained but a day, having a hurry for Rome, to
which I am thus far advanced. However, I went to the two galleries,
from which one returns drunk with beauty. The Venus is more for
admiration than love; but there are sculpture and painting, which
for the first time at all gave me an idea of what people mean by
their <i>cant</i>, and what Mr. Braham calls 'entusimusy' (<i>i.e.</i>
enthusiasm) about those two most artificial of the arts. What
struck me most were, the mistress of Raphael, a portrait; the
mistress of Titian, a portrait; a Venus of Titian in the Medici
gallery&mdash;<i>the</i> Venus; Canova's Venus also in the other gallery:
Titian's mistress is also in the other gallery (that is, in the
Pitti Palace gallery): the Parc&aelig; of Michael Angelo, a picture: and
the Antinous, the Alexander, and one or two not very decent groups
in marble; the Genius of Death, a sleeping figure, &amp;c. &amp;c.</p>

<p>"I also went to the Medici chapel&mdash;fine frippery in great slabs of
various expensive stones, to commemorate fifty rotten and forgotten
carcasses. It is unfinished, and will remain so.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Rome, May 5. 1817.</p>

<p>"By this post, (or next at farthest) I send you in two <i>other</i>
covers, the new third Act of 'Manfred.' I have re-written the
greater part, and returned what is not altered in the <i>proof</i> you
sent me. The Abbot is become a good man, and the Spirits are
brought in at the death. You will find I think,<span class="pagenum"><a id="page14" name="page14"></a>Pg 14</span> some good poetry
in this new act, here and there; and if so, print it, without
sending me farther proofs, <i>under Mr. Gifford's correction</i>, if he
will have the goodness to overlook it. Address all answers to
Venice, as usual; I mean to return there in ten days.</p>

<p>"'The Lament of Tasso,' which I sent from Florence, has, I trust,
arrived: I look upon it as a 'these be good rhymes,' as Pope's papa
said to him when he was a boy. For the two&mdash;it and the Drama&mdash;you
will disburse to me (<i>via</i> Kinnaird) <i>six</i> hundred guineas. You
will perhaps be surprised that I set the same price upon this as
upon the Drama; but, besides that I look upon it as <i>good</i>, I won't
take less than three hundred guineas for any thing. The two
together will make you a larger publication than the 'Siege' and
'Parisina;' so you may think yourself let off very easy: that is to
say, if these poems are good for any thing, which I hope and
believe.</p>

<p>"I have been some days in Rome the Wonderful. I am seeing sights,
and have done nothing else, except the new third Act for you. I
have this morning seen a live pope and a dead cardinal: Pius VII.
has been burying Cardinal Bracchi, whose body I saw in state at the
Chiesa Nuova. Rome has delighted me beyond every thing, since
Athens and Constantinople. But I shall not remain long this visit.
Address to Venice.</p>

<p>From the foregoing letters to Mr. Murray, we may collect some curious
particulars respecting one of the most original and sublime of the noble
poet's productions, the Drama of Manfred. His failure (and to an extent
of which the reader shall be enabled presently to judge), in the
completion of a design which he had, through two Acts, so magnificently
carried on,&mdash;the impatience with which, though conscious of this
failure, he as usual hurried to the press, without deigning to woo, or
wait for, a happier moment of inspiration,&mdash;his frank docility in, at
once, surrendering up his third Act to reprobation, without urging one
parental word in its behalf,&mdash;the doubt he evidently felt, whether, from
his habit of striking off these creations at a heat, he should be able
to rekindle his imagination on the subject,&mdash;and then, lastly, the
complete success with which, when his mind <i>did</i> make the spring, he at
once cleared the whole space by which he before fell short of
perfection,&mdash;all these circumstances, connected with the production of
this grand poem, lay open to us features, both of his disposition and
genius, in the highest degree interesting, and such as there is a
pleasure, second only to that of perusing the poem itself, in
contemplating.</p>

<p>As a literary curiosity, and, still more, as a lesson to genius, never
to rest satisfied with imperfection or mediocrity, but to labour on till
even failures are converted into triumphs, I shall here transcribe the
third Act, in its original shape, as first sent to the publisher:&mdash;</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page16" name="page16"></a>Pg 16</span></p>

<b>ACT III.&mdash;SCENE I.</b><br />
<br />
A Hall in the Castle of Manfred.<br />
<br />
<span class="stage2">MANFRED and HERMAN.</span><br />
<br />
<i>Man.</i> What is the hour?<br />
<br />
<i>Her.</i><span style="margin-left: 8em;">It wants but one till sunset,</span><br />
And promises a lovely twilight.<br />
<br />
<i>Man.</i><span style="margin-left: 10em;">Say,</span><br />
Are all things so disposed of in the tower<br />
As I directed?<br />
<br />
<i>Her.</i><span style="margin-left: 4em;">All, my lord, are ready:</span><br />
Here is the key and casket.<br />
<br />
<i>Man.</i><span style="margin-left: 9em;">It is well:</span><br />
Thou may'st retire. <span class="stage1">[<i>Exit</i> HERMAN.</span><br />
<br />
<i>Man.</i> (<i>alone.</i>) <span style="margin-left: 2em;">There is a calm upon me&mdash;</span><br />
Inexplicable stillness! which till now<br />
Did not belong to what I knew of life.<br />
If that I did not know philosophy<br />
To be of all our vanities the motliest,<br />
The merest word that ever fool'd the ear<br />
From out the schoolman's jargon, I should deem<br />
The golden secret, the sought 'Kalon,' found,<br />
And seated in my soul. It will not last,<br />
But it is well to have known it, though but once:<br />
It hath enlarged my thoughts with a new sense,<br />
And I within my tablets would note down<br />
That there is such a feeling. Who is there?<br />
<br />
<span class="stage2"><i>Re-enter</i> HERMAN.</span><br />
<br />
<i>Her.</i> My lord, the Abbot of St. Maurice craves<br />
To greet your presence.<br />
<br />
<span class="stage2"><i>Enter the</i> ABBOT OF ST. MAURICE.</span><br />
<br />
<i>Abbot.</i><span style="margin-left: 7em;">Peace be with Count Manfred!</span><br />
<br />
<i>Man.</i> Thanks, holy father! welcome to these walls;<br />
Thy presence honours them, and blesseth those<br />
Who dwell within them.<br />
<br />
<i>Abbot.</i><span style="margin-left: 7em;">Would it were so, Count!</span><br />
But I would fain confer with thee alone.<br /><span class="pagenum"><a id="page17" name="page17"></a>Pg 17</span>
<br />
<i>Man.</i> Herman, retire. What would my reverend guest?<br />
<br />
<span class="stage1"><i>Exit</i> HERMAN.</span><br />
<br />
<i>Abbot.</i> Thus, without prelude:&mdash;Age and zeal, my office,<br />
And good intent, must plead my privilege;<br />
Our near, though not acquainted neighbourhood,<br />
May also be my herald. Rumours strange,<br />
And of unholy nature, are abroad,<br />
And busy with thy name&mdash;a noble name<br />
For centuries; may he who bears it now<br />
Transmit it unimpair'd.<br />
<br />
<i>Man.</i><span style="margin-left: 7em;">Proceed,&mdash;I listen.</span><br />
<br />
<i>Abbot.</i> 'Tis said thou boldest converse with the things<br />
Which are forbidden to the search of man;<br />
That with the dwellers of the dark abodes,<br />
The many evil and unheavenly spirits<br />
Which walk the valley of the shade of death,<br />
Thou communest. I know that with mankind,<br />
Thy fellows in creation, thou dost rarely<br />
Exchange thy thoughts, and that thy solitude<br />
Is as an anchorite's, were it but holy.<br />
<br />
<i>Man.</i> And what are they who do avouch these things?<br />
<br />
<i>Abbot.</i> My pious brethren&mdash;the scared peasantry&mdash;<br />
Even thy own vassals&mdash;who do look on thee<br />
With most unquiet eyes. Thy life's in peril.<br />
<br />
<i>Man.</i> Take it.<br />
<br />
<i>Abbot.</i><span style="margin-left: 3em;">I come to save, and not destroy&mdash;</span><br />
I would not pry into thy secret soul;<br />
But if these things be sooth, there still is time<br />
For penitence and pity: reconcile thee<br />
With the true church, and through the church to heaven.<br />
<br />
<i>Man.</i> I hear thee. This is my reply; Whate'er<br />
I may have been, or am, doth rest between<br />
Heaven and myself.&mdash;I shall not choose a mortal<br />
To be my mediator. Have I sinn'd<br />
Against your ordinances? prove and punish!<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a><br /><span class="pagenum"><a id="page18" name="page18"></a>Pg 18</span>
<br />
<i>Abbot.</i> Then, hear and tremble! For the headstrong wretch<br />
Who in the mail of innate hardihood<br />
Would shield himself, and battle for his sins,<br />
There is the stake on earth, and beyond earth eternal&mdash;<br />
<br />
<i>Man.</i> Charity, most reverend father,<br />
Becomes thy lips so much more than this menace,<br />
That I would call thee back to it; but say,<br />
What wouldst thou with me?<br />
<br />
<i>Abbot.</i><span style="margin-left: 9em;">It may be there are</span><br />
Things that would shake thee&mdash;but I keep them back,<br />
And give thee till to-morrow to repent.<br />
Then if thou dost not all devote thyself<br />
To penance, and with gift of all thy lands<br />
To the monastery&mdash;<br />
<br />
<i>Man.</i><span style="margin-left: 6em;">I understand thee,&mdash;well!</span><br />
<br />
<i>Abbot.</i> Expect no mercy; I have warned thee.<br />
<br />

There is a gift for thee within this casket.<br />

He hath pursued long vigils in this tower,<br />
Without a witness. I have been within it,&mdash;<br />
So have we all been oft-times; but from it,<br />
Or its contents, it were impossible<br />
To draw conclusions absolute of aught<br />
His studies tend to. To be sure, there is<br />
One chamber where none enter; I would give<br />

A gloomy vigil, but a festal time,<br />
Merrier than day; he did not walk the rocks<br />

From men and their delights.<br />

positive in the very erroneous persuasion that they must have been
written by me. If you knew me as well as they do, you would have
fallen, perhaps, into the same mistake. Some day or other, I will
explain to you <i>why</i>&mdash;when I have time; at present, it does not
much matter; but you must have thought this blunder of theirs very
odd, and so did I, till I had read the book. Croker's letter to you
is a very great compliment; I shall return it to you in my next.</p>

<p>"I perceive you are publishing a Life of Raffael d'Urbino: it may
perhaps interest you to hear that a set of German artists here
allow their <i>hair</i> to grow, and trim it into <i>his fashion</i>, thereby
drinking the cummin of the disciples of the old philosopher; if
they would cut their hair, convert it into brushes, and paint like
him, it would be more '<i>German</i> to the matter.'</p>

<p>"I'll tell you a story: the other day, a man here&mdash;an
English&mdash;mistaking the statues of Charlemagne and Constantine,
which are <i>equestrian</i>, for those of Peter and Paul, asked another
<i>which</i> was Paul of these same horsemen?&mdash;to which the reply
was,&mdash;'I thought, sir, that St. Paul had never got on <i>horseback</i>
since his <i>accident</i>?'</p>

<p>"I'll tell you another: Henry Fox, writing to some one from Naples
the other day, after an illness, adds&mdash;'and I am so changed, that
my <i>oldest creditors</i> would hardly know me.'</p>

<p>"I am delighted with Rome&mdash;as I would be with<span class="pagenum"><a id="page26" name="page26"></a>Pg 26</span> a bandbox, that is,
it is a fine thing to see, finer than Greece; but I have not been
here long enough to affect it as a residence, and I must go back to
Lombardy, because I am wretched at being away from Marianna. I have
been riding my saddle-horses every day, and been to Albano, its
Lakes, and to the top of the Alban Mount, and to Frescati, Aricia,
&amp;c. &amp;c. with an &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c. about the city, and in the city: for
all which&mdash;vide Guide-book. As a whole, ancient and modern, it
beats Greece, Constantinople, every thing&mdash;at least that I have
ever seen. But I can't describe, because my first impressions are
always strong and confused, and my memory <i>selects</i> and reduces
them to order, like distance in the landscape, and blends them
better, although they may be less distinct. There must be a sense
or two more than we have, us mortals; for * * * * * where there is
much to be grasped we are always at a loss, and yet feel that we
ought to have a higher and more extended comprehension.</p>

<p>"I have had a letter from Moore, who is in some alarm about his
poem. I don't see why.</p>

<p>"I have had another from my poor dear Augusta, who is in a sad fuss
about my late illness; do, pray, tell her (the truth) that I am
better than ever, and in importunate health, growing (if not grown)
large and ruddy, and congratulated by impertinent persons on my
robustious appearance, when I ought to be pale and interesting.</p>

<p>"You tell me that George Byron has got a son, and Augusta says, a
daughter; which is it?&mdash;it is no great matter: the father is a good
man, an ex<span class="pagenum"><a id="page27" name="page27"></a>Pg 27</span>cellent officer, and has married a very nice little
woman, who will bring him more babes than income; howbeit she had a
handsome dowry, and is a very charming girl;&mdash;but he may as well
get a ship.</p>

<p>"I have no thoughts of coming amongst you yet awhile, so that I can
fight off business. If I could but make a tolerable sale of
Newstead, there would be no occasion for my return; and I can
assure you very sincerely, that I am much happier (or, at least,
have been so) out of your island than in it.</p>

<p>"Yours ever.</p>

<p>"P.S. There are few English here, but several of my acquaintance;
amongst others, the Marquis of Lansdowne, with whom I dine
to-morrow. I met the Jerseys on the road at Foligno&mdash;all well.</p>

<p>"Oh&mdash;I forgot&mdash;the Italians have printed Chillon, &amp;c. a
<i>piracy</i>,&mdash;a pretty little edition, prettier than yours&mdash;and
published, as I found to my great astonishment on arriving here;
and what is odd, is, that the English is quite correctly printed.
Why they did it, or who did it, I know not; but so it is;&mdash;I
suppose, for the English people. I will send you a copy."</p></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Rome, May 12. 1817.</p>

<p>"I have received your letter here, where I have taken a cruise
lately; but I shall return back to Venice in a few days, so that if
you write again, address there, as usual. I am not for returning
to<span class="pagenum"><a id="page28" name="page28"></a>Pg 28</span> England so soon as you imagine; and by no means at all as a
residence. If you cross the Alps in your projected expedition, you
will find me somewhere in Lombardy, and very glad to see you. Only
give me a word or two beforehand, for I would readily diverge some
leagues to meet you.</p>

<p>"Of Rome I say nothing; it is quite indescribable, and the
Guide-book is as good as any other. I dined yesterday with Lord
Lansdowne, who is on his return. But there are few English here at
present; the winter is <i>their</i> time. I have been on horseback most
of the day, all days since my arrival, and have taken it as I did
Constantinople. But Rome is the elder sister, and the finer. I went
some days ago to the top of the Alban Mount, which is superb. As
for the Coliseum, Pantheon, St. Peter's, the Vatican, Palatine, &amp;c.
&amp;c.&mdash;as I said, vide Guide-book. They are quite inconceivable, and
must <i>be seen</i>. The Apollo Belvidere is the image of Lady Adelaide
Forbes&mdash;I think I never saw such a likeness.</p>

<p>"I have seen the Pope alive, and a cardinal dead,&mdash;both of whom
looked very well indeed. The latter was in state in the Chiesa
Nuova, previous to his interment.</p>

<p>"Your poetical alarms are groundless; go on and prosper. Here is
Hobhouse just come in, and my horses at the door, so that I must
mount and take the field in the Campus Martius, which, by the way,
is all built over by modern Rome.</p>

<p><b>LETTER 280. TO MR. MURRAY.</b></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Venice, May 30. 1817.</p>

<p>"I returned from Rome two days ago, and have received your letter;
but no sign nor tidings of the parcel sent through Sir C. Stuart,
which you mention. After an interval of months, a packet of
'Tales,' &amp;c. found me at Rome; but this is all, and may be all that
ever will find me. The post seems to be the only sure conveyance;
and <i>that only for letters</i>. From Florence I sent you a poem on
Tasso, and from Rome the new third Act of 'Manfred,' and by Dr.
Polidori two portraits for my sister. I left Rome and made a rapid
journey home. You will continue to direct here as usual. Mr.
Hobhouse is gone to Naples: I should have run down there too for a
week, but for the quantity of English whom I heard of there. I
prefer hating them at a distance; unless an earthquake, or a good
real irruption of Vesuvius, were ensured to reconcile me to their
vicinity.</p>

<p>"The day before I left Rome I saw three robbers guillotined. The
ceremony&mdash;including the <i>masqued</i> priests; the half-naked
executioners; the bandaged criminals; the black Christ and his
banner; the scaffold; the soldiery; the slow procession, and the
quick rattle and heavy fall of the axe; the splash of the blood,
and the ghastliness of the exposed<span class="pagenum"><a id="page30" name="page30"></a>Pg 30</span> heads&mdash;is altogether more
impressive than the vulgar and ungentlemanly dirty 'new drop,' and
dog-like agony of infliction upon the sufferers of the English
sentence. Two of these men behaved calmly enough, but the first of
the three died with great terror and reluctance. What was very
horrible, he would not lie down; then his neck was too large for
the aperture, and the priest was obliged to drown his exclamations
by still louder exhortations. The head was off before the eye could
trace the blow; but from an attempt to draw back the head,
notwithstanding it was held forward by the hair, the first head was
cut off close to the ears: the other two were taken off more
cleanly. It is better than the oriental way, and (I should think)
than the axe of our ancestors. The pain seems little, and yet the
effect to the spectator, and the preparation to the criminal, is
very striking and chilling. The first turned me quite hot and
thirsty, and made me shake so that I could hardly hold the
opera-glass (I was close, but was determined to see, as one should
see every thing, once, with attention); the second and third (which
shows how dreadfully soon things grow indifferent), I am ashamed to
say, had no effect on me as a horror, though I would have saved
them if I could. Yours," &amp;c.</p></div>

Manfred, from Rome, which I sent soon after my arrival there. My

me, I have received <i>none</i> of your packets, except, after long

tragedy. Most of the things sent by the post have come&mdash;I mean
proofs and letters; therefore send me Marino Faliero by the post,
in a letter.</p>

<p>"I was delighted with Rome, and was on horseback all round it many
hours daily, besides in it the rest of my time, bothering over its
marvels. I excursed and skirred the country round to Alba, Tivoli,
Frescati, Licenza, &amp;c. &amp;c.; besides, I visited twice the Fall of
Terni, which beats every thing. On my way back, close to the temple
by its banks, I got some famous trout out of the river
Clitumnus&mdash;the prettiest little stream in all poesy, near the first
post from Foligno and Spoletto.&mdash;I did not stay at Florence, being
anxious to get home to Venice, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="page32" name="page32"></a>Pg 32</span> having already seen the
galleries and other sights. I left my commendatory letters the
evening before I went, so I saw nobody.</p>

<p>"To-day, Pindemonte, the celebrated poet of Verona, called on me;
he is a little thin man, with acute and pleasing features; his
address good and gentle; his appearance altogether very
philosophical; his age about sixty, or more. He is one of their
best going. I gave him <i>Forsyth</i>, as he speaks, or reads rather, a
little English, and will find there a favourable account of
himself. He enquired after his old Cruscan friends, Parsons,
Greathead, Mrs. Piozzi, and Merry, all of whom he had known in his
youth. I gave him as bad an account of them as I could, answering,
as the false 'Solomon Lob' does to 'Totterton' in the farce, 'all
gone dead,' and damned by a satire more than twenty years ago; that
the name of their extinguisher was Gifford; that they were but a
sad set of scribes after all, and no great things in any other way.
He seemed, as was natural, very much pleased with this account of
his old acquaintances, and went away greatly gratified with that
and Mr. Forsyth's sententious paragraph of applause in his own
(Pindemonte's) favour. After having been a little libertine in his
youth, he is grown devout, and takes prayers, and talks to himself,
to keep off the devil; but for all that, he is a very nice little
old gentleman.</p>

producing popes, painters, and sausages) I saw an anatomical
gallery, where there is a deal of waxwork, in which * *.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page33" name="page33"></a>Pg 33</span></p>

<p>"I am sorry to hear of your row with Hunt; but suppose him to be
exasperated by the Quarterly and your refusal to <i>deal</i>; and when
one is angry and edites a paper, I should think the temptation too
strong for literary nature, which is not always human. I can't
conceive in what, and for what, he abuses you: what have you done?
you are not an author, nor a politician, nor a public character; I
know no scrape you have tumbled into. I am the more sorry for this
because I introduced you to Hunt, and because I believe him to be a
good man; but till I know the particulars, I can give no opinion.</p>

<p>"Let me know about Lalla Rookh, which must be out by this time.</p>

<p>"I restore the proofs, but the <i>punctuation</i> should be corrected. I
feel too lazy to have at it myself; so beg and pray Mr. Gifford for
me.&mdash;Address to Venice. In a few days I go to my <i>villeggiatura</i>,
in a cassino near the Brenta, a few miles only on the main land. I
have determined on another year, and <i>many years</i> of residence if I
can compass them. Marianna is with me, hardly recovered of the
fever, which has been attacking all Italy last winter. I am afraid
she is a little hectic; but I hope the best.</p>

<p>"Ever, &amp;c.</p>

<p>"P.S. Torwaltzen has done a bust of me at Rome for Mr. Hobhouse,
which is reckoned very good. He is their best after Canova, and by
some preferred to him.</p>

<p>"I have had a letter from Mr. Hodgson. He is very happy, has got a
living, but not a child: if he<span class="pagenum"><a id="page34" name="page34"></a>Pg 34</span> had stuck to a curacy, babes would
have come of course, because he could not have maintained them.</p>

<p>"An Austrian officer, the other day, being in love with a Venetian,
was ordered, with his regiment, into Hungary. Distracted between
love and duty, he purchased a deadly drug, which dividing with his
mistress, both swallowed. The ensuing pains were terrific, but the
pills were purgative, and not poisonous, by the contrivance of the
unsentimental apothecary; so that so much suicide was all thrown
away. You may conceive the previous confusion and the final
laughter; but the intention was good on all sides."</p></div>

<p>"I write to you from the banks of the Brenta, a few miles from
Venice, where I have colonised for six months to come. Address, as
usual, to Venice.</p>

<p>"Three months after date (17th March),&mdash;like the unnegotiable bill
despondingly received by the reluctant tailor,&mdash;your despatch has
arrived, containing the extract from Moore's Italy and Mr.
Maturin's bankrupt tragedy. It is the absurd work of a clever man.
I think it might have done upon the stage, if he had made Manuel
(by some trickery, in a masque or vizor) fight his own battle,
instead of employing Molineux as his champion; and, after the
defeat of Torismond, have made him spare the son of his enemy, by
some revulsion of feeling, not incompatible with a character of
extravagant and distempered emotions. But as it is, what with the
Justiza, and the ridiculous conduct of the whole <i>dram. pers.</i> (for
they are all as mad as Manuel, who surely must have had more
interest with a corrupt bench than a distant relation and heir
presumptive, somewhat suspect of homicide,) I do not wonder at its
failure. As a play, it is impracticable; as a poem, no great
things. Who was the 'Greek that grappled with glory naked?' the
Olympic wrestlers? or Alexander the Great, when he ran stark round
the tomb of t'other fellow? or the Spartan who was<span class="pagenum"><a id="page36" name="page36"></a>Pg 36</span> fined by the
Ephori for fighting without his armour? or who? And as to 'flaying
off life like a garment,' helas! that's in Tom Thumb&mdash;see king
Arthur's soliloquy:</p>

<p>And the stage-directions&mdash;'Staggers among the bodies;'&mdash;the slain
are too numerous, as well as the blackamoor knights-penitent being
one too many: and De Zelos is such a shabby Monmouth Street
villain, without any redeeming quality&mdash;Stap my vitals! Maturin
seems to be declining into Nat. Lee. But let him try again; he has
talent, but not much taste. I 'gin to fear, or to hope, that
Sotheby, after all, is to be the Eschylus of the age, unless Mr.
Shiel be really worthy his success. The more I see of the stage,
the less I would wish to have any thing to do with it; as a proof
of which, I hope you have received the third Act of Manfred, which
will at least prove that I wish to steer very clear of the
possibility of being put into scenery. I sent it from <i>Rome</i>.</p>

<p>"I returned the proof of Tasso. By the way, have you never received
a translation of St. Paul which I sent you, <i>not</i> for publication,
before I went to Rome?</p>

<p>"If you can convey the enclosed letter to its address, or discover
the person to whom it is directed, you will confer a favour upon
the Venetian creditor of a deceased Englishman. This epistle is a
dun to his executor, for house-rent. The name of the insolvent
defunct is, or was, <i>Porter Valter</i>, according to the account of
the plaintiff, which I rather suspect ought to be <i>Walter Porter</i>,
according to our mode of collocation. If you are acquainted with
any dead man of the like name a good deal in debt, pray dig him up,
and tell him that 'a pound of his fair flesh' or the ducats are
required, and that 'if you deny them, fie upon your law!'</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page42" name="page42"></a>Pg 42</span></p>

perhaps some tidings. I write to you with people talking Venetian
all about, so that you must not expect this letter to be all
English.</p>

<p>"The other day, I had a squabble on the highway, as follows: I was
riding pretty quickly from Dolo home about eight in the evening,
when I passed a party of people in a hired carriage, one of whom,
poking his head out of the window, began bawling to me in an
inarticulate but insolent manner. I wheeled my horse round, and
overtaking, stopped the coach, and said, 'Signor, have you any
commands for me?' He replied, impudently as to manner, 'No.' I then
asked him what he meant by that unseemly noise, to the discomfiture
of the passers-by. He replied by some piece of impertinence, to
which I answered by giving him a violent slap in the face. I then
dismounted, (for this passed at the window, I being on horseback
still,) and opening the door desired him to walk out, or I would
give him another. But the first had settled him except as to words,
of which he poured forth a profusion in blasphemies, swearing that
he would go to the police and avouch a battery sans provocation. I
said he lied, and was a * *, and if he did not hold his tongue,
should be dragged out and beaten anew. He then held his tongue. I
of course told him my name and residence, and defied him to the
death, if he were a gentleman, or not a gentleman, and had the
inclination to be genteel in the way of combat. He went to the
police, but there<span class="pagenum"><a id="page43" name="page43"></a>Pg 43</span> having been bystanders in the
road,&mdash;particularly a soldier, who had seen the business,&mdash;as well
as my servant, notwithstanding the oaths of the coachman and five
insides besides the plaintiff, and a good deal of paying on all
sides, his complaint was dismissed, he having been the
aggressor;&mdash;and I was subsequently informed that, had I not given
him a blow, he might have been had into durance.</p>

<p>"So set down this,&mdash;'that in Aleppo once' I 'beat a Venetian;' but
I assure you that he deserved it, for I am a quiet man, like
Candide, though with somewhat of his fortune in being forced to
forego my natural meekness every now and then.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"La Mira, near Venice, July 15. 1817.</p>

<p>"I have finished (that is, written&mdash;the file comes afterwards)
ninety and eight stanzas of the fourth Canto, which I mean to be
the concluding one. It will probably be about the same length as
the <i>third</i>, being already of the dimensions of the first or second
Cantos. I look upon parts of it as very good, that is, if the three
former are good, but this we shall see; and at any rate, good or
not, it is rather a different style from the last&mdash;less
metaphysical&mdash;which, at any rate, will be a variety. I sent you the
shaft of the column as a specimen the other day, <i>i.e.</i> the first
stanza. So you may be thinking of its arrival towards autumn, whose
winds will not be the only ones to be raised, <i>if so be as how
that</i> it is ready by that time.</p>

<p>"I lent Lewis, who is at Venice, (in or on the Canalaccio, the
Grand Canal,) your extracts from Lalla Rookh and Manuel<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a>, and,
out of contradiction, it may be, he likes the last, and is not much
taken with the first, of these performances. Of Manuel, I think,
with the exception of a few capers, it is as heavy a nightmare as
was ever bestrode by indigestion.</p>

<p>"Of the extracts I can but judge as extracts, and I prefer the
'Peri' to the 'Silver Veil.' He seems not so much at home in his
versification of the 'Silver Veil,' and a little embarrassed with
his horrors; but the conception of the character of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="page48" name="page48"></a>Pg 48</span> impostor
is fine, and the plan of great scope for his genius,&mdash;and I doubt
not that, as a whole, it will be very Arabesque and beautiful.</p>

<p>"Your late epistle is not the most abundant in information, and has
not yet been succeeded by any other; so that I know nothing of your
own concerns, or of any concerns, and as I never hear from any body
but yourself who does not tell me something as disagreeable as
possible, I should not be sorry to hear from you: and as it is not
very probable,&mdash;if I can, by any device or possible arrangement
with regard to my personal affairs, so arrange it,&mdash;that I shall
return soon, or reside ever in England, all that you tell me will
be all I shall know or enquire after, as to our beloved realm of
Grub Street, and the black brethren and blue sisterhood of that
extensive suburb of Babylon. Have you had no new babe of literature
sprung up to replace the dead, the distant, the tired, and the

<i>ultimate</i> Canto of Childe Harold. It consists of 126 stanzas, and
is consequently the longest of the four. It is yet to be copied and
polished; and the notes are to come, of which it will require more
than the <i>third</i> Canto, as it necessarily treats more of works of
art than of nature. It shall be sent towards autumn;&mdash;and now for
our<span class="pagenum"><a id="page49" name="page49"></a>Pg 49</span> barter. What do you bid? eh? you shall have samples, an' it so
please you: but I wish to know what I am to expect (as the saying
is) in these hard times, when poetry does not let for half its
value. If you are disposed to do what Mrs. Winifred Jenkins calls
'the handsome thing,' I may perhaps throw you some odd matters to
the lot,&mdash;translations, or slight originals; there is no saying
what may be on the anvil between this and the booking season.
Recollect that it is the <i>last</i> Canto, and completes the work;
whether as good as the others, I cannot judge, in course&mdash;least of
all as yet,&mdash;but it shall be as little worse as I can help. I may,
perhaps, give some little gossip in the notes as to the present
state of Italian literati and literature, being acquainted with
some of their <i>capi</i>&mdash;men as well as books;&mdash;but this depends upon
my humour at the time. So, now, pronounce: I say nothing.</p>

venture on an edition of the whole poem in quarto, with spare

<p>"Your letter of the 18th, and, what will please you, as it did me,
the parcel sent by the good-natured aid and abetment of Mr. Croker,
are arrived.&mdash;Messrs. Lewis and Hobhouse are here: the former in
the same house, the latter a few hundred yards distant.</p>

<p>"You say nothing of Manfred, from which its failure may be
inferred; but I think it odd you should not say so at once. I know
nothing, and hear absolutely nothing, of any body or any thing in
England; and there are no English papers, so that all you say will
be news&mdash;of any person, or thing, or things. I am at present very
anxious about Newstead, and sorry that Kinnaird is leaving England
at this minute, though I do not tell him so, and would rather he
should have <i>his</i> pleasure, although it may not in this instance
tend to my profit.</p>

<p>"If I understand rightly, you have paid into Morland's 1500
<i>pounds</i>: as the agreement in the paper is two thousand <i>guineas</i>,
there will remain therefore <i>six</i> hundred <i>pounds</i>, and not five
hundred, the odd hundred being the extra to make up the specie. Six
hundred and thirty pounds will bring it to the like for Manfred and
Tasso, making a total of twelve hundred and thirty, I believe, for
I am not a good calculator. I do not wish to press you, but I tell
you fairly that it will be a convenience to me to<span class="pagenum"><a id="page51" name="page51"></a>Pg 51</span> have it paid as
soon as it can be made convenient to yourself.</p>

<p>"The new and last Canto is 130 stanzas in length; and may be made
more or less. I have fixed no price, even in idea, and have no
notion of what it may be good for. There are no metaphysics in it;
at least, I think not. Mr. Hobhouse has promised me a copy of
Tasso's Will, for notes; and I have some curious things to say
about Ferrara, and Parisina's story, and perhaps a farthing
candle's worth of light upon the present state of Italian
literature. I shall hardly be ready by October; but that don't
matter. I have all to copy and correct, and the notes to write.</p>

the '<i>Ariosto</i> of the North' in my <i>text</i>. <i>If he should not, say so
in time.</i></p>

<p>"An Italian translation of 'Glenarvon' came lately to be printed at
Venice. The censor (Sr. Petrotini) refused to sanction the
publication till he had seen me on the subject. I told him that I
did not recognise the slightest relation between that book and
myself; but that, whatever opinions might be upon that subject, <i>I</i>
would never prevent or oppose the publication of <i>any</i> book, in
<i>any</i> language, on my own private account; and desired him (against
his inclination) to permit the poor translator to publish his
labours. It is going forwards in consequence. You may say this,

the poem by omitting the last line of Manfred's speaking; and why
this was done, I know not. Why you persist in saying nothing of the
thing itself, I am equally at a loss to conjecture. If it is for
fear of telling me something disagreeable, you are wrong; because
sooner or later I must know it, and I am not so new, nor so raw,
nor so inexperienced, as not to be able to bear, not the mere
paltry, petty disappointments of authorship, but things more
serious,&mdash;at least I hope so, and that what you may think
irritability is merely mechanical, and only acts like galvanism on
a dead body, or the muscular motion which survives sensation.</p>

<p>"If it is that you are out of humour, because I wrote to you a
sharp letter, recollect that it was partly from a misconception of
your letter, and partly because you did a thing you had no right to
do without consulting me.</p>

<p>Among those minor misrepresentations of which it was Lord Byron's fate
to be the victim, advantage was, at this time, taken of his professed
distaste to the English, to accuse him of acts of inhospitality, and
even rudeness, towards some of his fellow-countrymen. How far different
was his treatment of all who ever visited him, many grateful
testimonies<span class="pagenum"><a id="page57" name="page57"></a>Pg 57</span> might be collected to prove; but I shall here content
myself with selecting a few extracts from an account given me by Mr.
Henry Joy of a visit which, in company with another English gentleman,
he paid to the noble poet this summer, at his villa on the banks of the
Brenta. After mentioning the various civilities they had experienced
from Lord Byron; and, among others, his having requested them to name
their own day for dining with him,&mdash;"We availed ourselves," says Mr.
Joy, "of this considerate courtesy by naming the day fixed for our
return to Padua, when our route would lead us to his door; and we were
welcomed with all the cordiality which was to be expected from so
friendly a bidding. Such traits of kindness in such a man deserve to be
recorded on account of the numerous slanders thrown upon him by some of
the tribes of tourists, who resented, as a personal affront, his
resolution to avoid their impertinent inroads upon his retirement. So
far from any appearance of indiscriminate aversion to his countrymen,
his enquiries about his friends in England (<i>quorum pars magna fuisti</i>)
were most anxious and particular.</p>

<p>"He expressed some opinions," continues my informant, "on matters of
taste, which cannot fail to interest his biographer. He contended that
Sculpture, as an art, was vastly superior to Painting;&mdash;a preference
which is strikingly illustrated by the fact that, in the fourth Canto of
Childe Harold, he gives the most elaborate and splendid account of
several statues, and none of any pictures; although Italy is,
emphatically, the land of painting,<span class="pagenum"><a id="page58" name="page58"></a>Pg 58</span> and her best statues are derived
from Greece. By the way, he told us that there were more objects of
interest in Rome alone than in all Greece from one extremity to the
other. After regaling us with an excellent dinner, (in which, by the by,
a very English joint of roast beef showed that he did not extend his
antipathies to all John-Bullisms,) he took me in his carriage some miles
of our route towards Padua, after apologising to my fellow-traveller for
the separation, on the score of his anxiety to hear all he could of his
friends in England; and I quitted him with a confirmed impression of the
strong ardour and sincerity of his attachment to those by whom he did
not fancy himself slighted or ill treated."</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Sept. 4. 1817.</p>

<p>"Your letter of the 15th has conveyed with its contents the
impression of a seal, to which the 'Saracen's Head' is a seraph,
and the 'Bull and Mouth' a delicate device. I knew that calumny had
sufficiently <i>blackened</i> me of later days, but not that it had
given the features as well as complexion of a negro. Poor Augusta
is not less, but rather more, shocked than myself, and says 'people
seem to have lost their recollection strangely' when they engraved
such a 'blackamoor.' Pray don't seal (at least to me) with such a
caricature of the human numskull altogether; and if you don't break
the seal-cutter's head, at least crack his libel (or likeness, if
it should be a likeness) of mine.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page59" name="page59"></a>Pg 59</span>"Mr. Kinnaird is not yet arrived, but expected. He has lost by the
way all the tooth-powder, as a letter from Spa informs me.</p>

<p>"By Mr. Rose I received safely, though tardily, magnesia and
tooth-powder, and * * * *. Why do you send me such trash&mdash;worse
than trash, the Sublime of Mediocrity? Thanks for Lalla, however,
which is good; and thanks for the Edinburgh and Quarterly, both
very amusing and well-written. Paris in 1815, &amp;c.&mdash;good. Modern
Greece&mdash;good for nothing; written by some one who has never been
there, and not being able to manage the Spenser stanza, has
invented a thing of his own, consisting of two elegiac stanzas, an
heroic line, and an Alexandrine, twisted on a string. Besides, why
'<i>modern</i>?' You may say <i>modern Greeks</i>, but surely <i>Greece</i> itself
is rather more ancient than ever it was. Now for business.</p>

<p>"You offer 1500 guineas for the new Canto: I won't take it. I ask
two thousand five hundred guineas for it, which you will either
give or not, as you think proper. It concludes the poem, and
consists of 144 stanzas. The notes are numerous, and chiefly
written by Mr. Hobhouse, whose researches have been indefatigable;
and who, I will venture to say, has more real knowledge of Rome and
its environs than any Englishman who has been there since Gibbon.
By the way, to prevent any mistakes, I think it necessary to state
the fact that <i>he</i>, Mr. Hobhouse, has no interest whatever in the
price or profit to be derived from the copyright of either poem or
notes directly or indirectly; so that you<span class="pagenum"><a id="page60" name="page60"></a>Pg 60</span> are not to suppose that
it is by, for, or through him, that I require more for this Canto
than the preceding.&mdash;No: but if Mr. Eustace was to have had two
thousand for a poem on Education; if Mr. Moore is to have three
thousand for Lalla, &amp;c.; if Mr. Campbell is to have three thousand
for his prose on poetry&mdash;I don't mean to disparage these gentlemen
in their labours&mdash;but I ask the aforesaid price for mine. You will
tell me that their productions are considerably <i>longer</i>: very
true, and when they shorten them, I will lengthen mine, and ask
less. You shall submit the MS. to Mr. Gifford, and any other two
gentlemen to be named by you, (Mr. Frere, or Mr. Croker, or
whomever you please, except such fellows as your * *s and * *s,)
and if they pronounce this Canto to be inferior as a <i>whole</i> to the
preceding, I will not appeal from their award, but burn the
manuscript, and leave things as they are.</p>

<p>"Yours very truly.</p>

<p>"P.S. In answer to a former letter, I sent you a short statement of
what I thought the state of our present copyright account, viz. six
hundred <i>pounds</i> still (or lately) due on Childe Harold, and six
hundred <i>guineas</i>, Manfred and Tasso, making a total of twelve
hundred and thirty pounds. If we agree about the new poem, I shall
take the liberty to reserve the choice of the manner in which it
should be published, viz. a quarto, certes."</p></div><p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page61" name="page61"></a>Pg 61</span></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"La Mira, Sept. 12. 1817.</p>

<p>"I set out yesterday morning with the intention of paying my
respects, and availing myself of your permission to walk over the
premises.<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> On arriving at Padua, I found that the march of the
Austrian troops had engrossed so many horses<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a>, that those I could
procure were hardly able to crawl; and their weakness, together
with the prospect of finding none at all at the post-house of
Monselice, and consequently either not arriving that day at Este,
or so late as to be unable to return home the same evening, induced
me to turn aside in a second visit to Arqua, instead of proceeding
onwards; and even thus I hardly got back in time.</p>

<p>"Next week I shall be obliged to be in Venice to meet Lord Kinnaird
and his brother, who are<span class="pagenum"><a id="page62" name="page62"></a>Pg 62</span> expected in a few days. And this

of the Austrians for the next few days, will not allow me to fix
any precise period for availing myself of your kindness, though I
should wish to take the earliest opportunity. Perhaps, if absent,
you will have the goodness to permit one of your servants to show
me the grounds and house, or as much of either as may be

<p><b>LETTER 297. TO MR. MURRAY.</b></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"September 15. 1817.</p>

<p>"I enclose a sheet for correction, if ever you get to another
edition. You will observe that the blunder in printing makes it
appear as if the Ch&acirc;teau was <i>over</i> St. Gingo, instead of being on
the opposite shore of the Lake, over Clarens. So, separate the
paragraphs, otherwise my <i>to</i>pography will seem as inaccurate as
your <i>ty</i>pography on this occasion.</p>

<p>"The other day I wrote to convey my proposition with regard to the
fourth and concluding Canto. I have gone over and extended it to
one hundred and fifty stanzas, which is almost as long as the two
first were originally, and longer by itself than any of the smaller
poems except 'The Corsair.' Mr. Hobhouse has made some very
valuable and accurate notes of considerable length, and you may be
sure that I will<span class="pagenum"><a id="page63" name="page63"></a>Pg 63</span> do for the text all that I can to finish with
decency. I look upon Childe Harold as my best; and as I begun, I
think of concluding with it. But I make no resolutions on that
head, as I broke my former intention with regard to 'The Corsair.'
However, I fear that I shall never do better; and yet, not being
thirty years of age, for some moons to come, one ought to be
progressive as far as intellect goes for many a good year. But I
have had a devilish deal of tear and wear of mind and body in my
time, besides having published too often and much already. God
grant me some judgment to do what may be most fitting in that and
every thing else, for I doubt my own exceedingly.</p>

<p>"I have read 'Lalla Rookh,' but not with sufficient attention yet,
for I ride about, and lounge, and ponder, and&mdash;two or three other
things; so that my reading is very desultory, and not so attentive
as it used to be. I am very glad to hear of its popularity, for
Moore is a very noble fellow in all respects, and will enjoy it
without any of the bad feelings which success&mdash;good or
evil&mdash;sometimes engenders in the men of rhyme. Of the poem, itself,
I will tell you my opinion when I have mastered it: I say of the
<i>poem</i>, for I don't like the <i>prose</i> at all; and in the mean time,
the 'Fire-worshippers' is the best, and the 'Veiled Prophet' the
worst, of the volume.</p>

<p>"With regard to poetry in general<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a>, I am con<span class="pagenum"><a id="page64" name="page64"></a>Pg 64</span>vinced, the more I
think of it, that he and <i>all</i> of us&mdash;Scott, Southey, Wordsworth,
Moore, Campbell, I,&mdash;are all in the wrong, one as much as another;
that we are upon a wrong revolutionary poetical system, or systems,
not worth a damn in itself, and from which none but Rogers and
Crabbe are free; and that the present and next generations will
finally be of this opinion. I am the more confirmed in this by
having lately gone over some of our classics, particularly <i>Pope</i>,
whom I tried in this way,&mdash;I took Moore's poems and my own and some
others, and went over them side by side with Pope's, and I was
really astonished (I ought not to have been so) and mortified at
the ineffable distance in point of sense, learning, effect, and
even <i>imagination</i>, passion, and <i>invention</i>, between the little
Queen Anne's man, and us of the Lower Empire. Depend upon it, it is
all Horace then, and Claudian now, among us; and if I had to begin
again, I would mould myself accordingly. Crabbe's the man, but he
has got a coarse and impracticable subject, and * * * is retired
upon half-pay, and has done enough, unless he were to do as he did
formerly."</p></div>

both great luxuries here, and neither to be had good, or indeed
hardly at all, of the natives. * * *</p>

<p>"In * *'s Life, I perceive an attack upon the then Committee of
D.L. Theatre for acting Bertram, and an attack upon Maturin's
Bertram for being acted. Considering all things, this is not very
grateful nor graceful on the part of the worthy autobiographer;<span class="pagenum"><a id="page66" name="page66"></a>Pg 66</span>

pains to forward the views of * * out of the question, I know that
there was every disposition, on the part of the Sub-Committee, to
bring forward any production of his, were it feasible. The play he
offered, though poetical, did not appear at all practicable, and
Bertram did;&mdash;and hence this long tirade, which is the last chapter
of his vagabond life.</p>

<p>"As for Bertram, Maturin may defend his own begotten, if he likes
it well enough; I leave the Irish clergyman and the new Orator
Henley to battle it out between them, satisfied to have done the
best I could for <i>both</i>. I may say this to <i>you</i>, who know it.</p>

<p>"Mr. * * may console himself with the fervour,&mdash;the almost
religious fervour of his and W * *'s disciples, as he calls it. If
he means that as any proof of their merits, I will find him as much
'fervour' in behalf of Richard Brothers and Joanna Southcote as
ever gathered over his pages or round his fire-side.</p>

<p>"My answer to your proposition about the fourth Canto you will have
received, and I await yours;&mdash;perhaps we may not agree. I have
since written a poem (of 84 octave stanzas), humorous, in or after
the excellent manner of Mr. Whistlecraft (whom I take to be Frere),
on a Venetian anecdote which amused me:&mdash;but till I have your

<p>"Mr. Hobhouse does not return to England in November, as he
intended, but will winter here<span class="pagenum"><a id="page67" name="page67"></a>Pg 67</span> and as he is to convey the poem, or

(which, by the way, I shall not perhaps include in the same
publication or agreement,) I shall not be able to publish so soon
as expected; but I suppose there is no harm in the delay.</p>

<p>"I have <i>signed</i> and sent your former <i>copyrights</i> by Mr. Kinnaird,

Kinnaird has a power of attorney to sign for me, and will, when
necessary.</p>

Manfred, and defends its originality, which I did not know that any
body had attacked. I <i>never read</i>, and do not know that I ever saw,
the 'Faustus of Marlow,' and had, and have, no dramatic works by me
in English, except the recent things you sent me; but I heard Mr.
Lewis translate verbally some scenes of <i>Goethe's Faust</i> (which
were, some good, and some bad) last summer;&mdash;which is all I know of
the history of that magical personage; and as to the germs of
Manfred, they may be found in the Journal which I sent to Mrs.
Leigh (part of which you saw) when I went over first the Dent de
Jaman, and then the Wengen or Wengeberg Alp and Sheideck, and made
the giro of the Jungfrau, Shreckhorn, &amp;c. &amp;c. shortly before I left
Switzerland. I have the whole scene of Manfred before me as if it
was but yesterday, and could point it out, spot by spot, torrent
and all.</p>

<p>"Of the Prometheus of &AElig;schylus I was passionately fond as a boy (it
was one of the Greek plays<span class="pagenum"><a id="page68" name="page68"></a>Pg 68</span> we read thrice a year at
Harrow);&mdash;indeed that and the 'Medea' were the only ones, except
the 'Seven before Thebes,' which ever much pleased me. As to the
'Faustus of Marlow,' I never read, never saw, nor heard of it&mdash;at
least, thought of it, except that I think Mr. Gifford mentioned, in
a note of his which you sent me, something about the catastrophe;
but not as having any thing to do with mine, which may or may not
resemble it, for any thing I know.</p>

<p>"The Prometheus, if not exactly in my plan, has always been so much
in my head, that I can easily conceive its influence over all or

publish it anonymously; but this we will see to by and by.</p>

up the publication on account of the <i>Hollands</i>, and I do not think
that any time or circumstances can neutralise the suppression. Add
to which, that, after being on terms with almost all the bards and
critics of the day, it would be savage at any time, but worst of
all <i>now</i>, to revive this foolish lampoon.</p>

<p>"The review of Manfred came very safely, and I am much pleased with
it. It is odd that they should say (that is somebody in a magazine
whom the Edinburgh controverts) that it was taken from Marlow's
Faust, which I never read nor saw. An American, who came the other

Goethe's Faust. The devil may take both the Faustuses, German and

Admiralty, and its bookseller. I used to think that <i>I</i> was a good

<p>"Do you remember my mentioning, some months ago, the Marquis
Moncada&mdash;a Spaniard of distinction and fourscore years, my summer
neighbour at La Mira? Well, about six weeks ago, he fell in love
with a Venetian girl of family, and no fortune or character; took
her into his mansion; quarrelled with all his former friends for
giving him advice (except me who gave him none), and installed her
present concubine and future wife and mistress of himself and
furniture. At the end of a month, in which she demeaned herself as
ill as possible, he found out a<span class="pagenum"><a id="page73" name="page73"></a>Pg 73</span> correspondence between her and
some former keeper, and after nearly strangling, turned her out of
the house, to the great scandal of the keeping part of the town,
and with a prodigious &eacute;clat, which has occupied all the canals and
coffee-houses in Venice. He said she wanted to poison him; and she
says&mdash;God knows what; but between them they have made a great deal
of noise. I know a little of both the parties: Moncada seemed a
very sensible old man, a character which he has not quite kept up
on this occasion; and the woman is rather showy than pretty. For
the honour of religion, she was bred in a convent, and for the
credit of Great Britain, taught by an Englishwoman.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Venice, December 3. 1817.</p>

<p>"A Venetian lady, learned and somewhat stricken in years, having,
in her intervals of love and devotion, taken upon her to translate
the Letters and write the Life of Lady Mary Wortley Montague,&mdash;to
which undertaking there are two obstacles, firstly, ignorance of
English, and, secondly, a total dearth of information on the
subject of her projected biography, has applied to me for facts or
falsities upon this promising project. Lady Montague lived the last
twenty or more years of her life in or near Venice, I believe; but
here they know nothing, and remember nothing, for the story of
to-day is succeeded by the scandal of to-morrow; and the wit, and
beauty, and gallantry, which might render your<span class="pagenum"><a id="page74" name="page74"></a>Pg 74</span> countrywoman
notorious in her own country, must have been <i>here</i> no great
distinction&mdash;because the first is in no request, and the two latter
are common to all women, or at least the last of them. If you can
therefore tell me any thing, or get any thing told, of Lady Wortley
Montague, I shall take it as a favour, and will transfer and
translate it to the 'Dama' in question. And I pray you besides to
send me, by some quick and safe voyager, the edition of her
Letters, and the stupid Life, by <i>Dr. Dallaway</i>, published by her
proud and foolish family.</p>

<p>"The death of the Princess Charlotte has been a shock even here,
and must have been an earthquake at home. The Courier's list of
some three hundred heirs to the crown (including the house of
Wirtemberg, with that * * *, P&mdash;&mdash;, of disreputable memory, whom I
remember seeing at various balls during the visit of the
Muscovites, &amp;c. in 1814) must be very consolatory to all true
lieges, as well as foreigners, except Signor Travis, a rich Jew
merchant of this city, who complains grievously of the length of
British mourning, which has countermanded all the silks which he
was on the point of transmitting, for a year to come. The death of
this poor girl is melancholy in every respect, dying at twenty or
so, in childbed&mdash;of a <i>boy</i> too, a present princess and future
queen, and just as she began to be happy, and to enjoy herself, and
the hopes which she inspired.</p>

<p>"I think, as far as I can recollect, she is the first royal defunct
in childbed upon record in <i>our</i> history. I feel sorry in every
respect&mdash;for the loss of a female reign, and a woman hitherto
harmless; and all the<span class="pagenum"><a id="page75" name="page75"></a>Pg 75</span> lost rejoicings, and addresses, and
drunkenness, and disbursements, of John Bull on the occasion.</p>

<p>"The Prince will marry again, after divorcing his wife, and Mr.
Southey will write an elegy now, and an ode then; the Quarterly
will have an article against the press, and the Edinburgh an
article, <i>half</i> and <i>half</i>, about reform and right of divorce; the
British will give you Dr. Chalmers's funeral sermon much commended,
with a place in the stars for deceased royalty; and the Morning

<p>Of his daily rides on the Lido, which he mentions in this letter, the
following account, by a gentleman who lived a good deal with him at
Venice, will be found not a little interesting:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Almost immediately after Mr. Hobhouse's departure, Lord Byron proposed
to me to accompany him in his rides on the Lido. One of the long narrow
islands which separate the Lagune, in the midst of which Venice stands,
from the Adriatic, is more particularly distinguished by this name. At
one extremity is a fortification, which, with the Castle of St. Andrea
on an island on the opposite side, defends the nearest entrance to the
city from the sea. In times of peace this fortification is almost
dismantled, and Lord Byron had hired here of the Commandant an
unoccupied stable, where he kept his horses. The distance from the city
was not very considerable; it was much less than to the Terra Firma,
and, as far as it went, the spot was not ineligible for riding.</p>

<p>"Every day that the weather would permit, Lord Byron called for me in
his gondola, and we found the horses waiting for us outside of the fort.
We rode as far as we could along the sea-shore, and then on a kind of
dyke, or embankment, which has been raised where the island was very
narrow, as far as another small fort about half way between the
principal one which I have already mentioned, and the town or village of
Malamocco, which is near the other extremity of the island,&mdash;the
distance between the two forts being about three miles.</p>

<p>"On the land side of the embankment, not far<span class="pagenum"><a id="page83" name="page83"></a>Pg 83</span> from the smaller fort, was
a boundary stone which probably marked some division of property,&mdash;all
the side of the island nearest the Lagune being divided into gardens for
the cultivation of vegetables for the Venetian markets. At the foot of
this stone Lord Byron repeatedly told me that I should cause him to be
interred, if he should die in Venice, or its neighbourhood, during my
residence there; and he appeared to think, as he was not a Catholic,
that, on the part of the government, there could be no obstacle to his
interment in an unhallowed spot of ground by the sea-side. At all
events, I was to overcome whatever difficulties might be raised on this
account. I was, by no means, he repeatedly told me, to allow his body to
be removed to England, nor permit any of his family to interfere with
his funeral.</p>

<p>"Nothing could be more delightful than these rides on the Lido were to
me. We were from half to three quarters of an hour crossing the water,
during which his conversation was always most amusing and interesting.
Sometimes he would bring with him any new book he had received, and read
to me the passages which most struck him. Often he would repeat to me
whole stanzas of the poems he was engaged in writing, as he had composed
them on the preceding evening; and this was the more interesting to me,
because I could frequently trace in them some idea which he had started
in our conversation of the preceding day, or some remark, the effect of
which he had been evidently trying upon me. Occasionally, too, he spoke
of his own<span class="pagenum"><a id="page84" name="page84"></a>Pg 84</span> affairs, making me repeat all I had heard with regard to
him, and desiring that I would not spare him, but let him know the worst
that was said."</p>

<p>"I remember to have seen Porson at Cambridge,<span class="pagenum"><a id="page85" name="page85"></a>Pg 85</span> in the hall of our
college, and in private parties, but not frequently; and I never
can recollect him except as drunk or brutal, and generally both: I
mean in an evening, for in the hall he dined at the Dean's table,
and I at the Vice-master's, so that I was not near him; and he then
and there appeared sober in his demeanour, nor did I ever hear of
excess or outrage on his part in public,&mdash;commons, college, or
chapel; but I have seen him in a private party of undergraduates,
many of them fresh men and strangers, take up a poker to one of
them, and heard him use language as blackguard as his action. I
have seen Sheridan drunk, too, with all the world; but his
intoxication was that of Bacchus, and Porson's that of Silenus. Of
all the disgusting brutes, sulky, abusive, and intolerable, Porson
was the most bestial, as far as the few times that I saw him went,
which were only at William Bankes's (the Nubian discoverer's)
rooms. I saw him once go away in a rage, because nobody knew the
name of the 'Cobbler of Messina,' insulting their ignorance with
the most vulgar terms of reprobation. He was tolerated in this
state amongst the young men for his talents, as the Turks think a
madman inspired, and bear with him. He used to recite, or rather
vomit, pages of all languages, and could hiccup Greek like a Helot;
and certainly Sparta never shocked her children with a grosser
exhibition than this man's intoxication.</p>

<p>"I perceive, in the book you sent me, a long account of him, which
is very savage. I cannot judge, as I never saw him sober, except in
<i>hall</i> or combin<span class="pagenum"><a id="page86" name="page86"></a>Pg 86</span>ation-room; and then I was never near enough to
hear, and hardly to see him. Of his drunken deportment, I can be
sure, because I saw it.</p>

<p>"With the Reviews I have been much entertained. It requires to be
as far from England as I am to relish a periodical paper properly:
it is like soda-water in an Italian summer. But what cruel work you
make with Lady * * * *! You should recollect that she is a woman;
though, to be sure, they are now and then very provoking; still, as
authoresses, they can do no great harm; and I think it a pity so
much good invective should have been laid out upon her, when there
is such a fine field of us Jacobin gentlemen for you to work upon.</p>

domestic loss. Thus it is&mdash;'medio de fonte leporum'&mdash;in the acm&eacute; of
his fame and his happiness comes a drawback as usual.</p>

having kept clear of all their literary parties, both here and at
Milan, and elsewhere.&mdash;I came into Italy to feel the climate and be
quiet, if possible. Mossi's translation I would have prevented, if
I had known it, or could have done so; and I trust that I shall yet
be in time to stop this new gentleman, of whom I heard yesterday
for the first time. He will only hurt himself, and do no good to
his party, for in <i>party</i> the whole thing originates. Our modes of
thinking and writing are so unutterably different, that I can
conceive no greater absurdity than attempting to make any approach
between the English and Italian poetry of the present day. I like
the people very much, and their literature very much, but I am not
the least ambitious of being the subject of their discussions
literary and personal (which appear to be pretty much the same
thing, as is the case in most countries); and if you can aid me in
impeding this publication, you will add to much kindness already
received from you by yours Ever and truly,</p>

<p><b>LETTER 310. TO MR. ROGERS.</b></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Venice, March 3. 1828.</p>

<p>"I have not, as you say, 'taken to wife the Adriatic.' I heard of
Moore's loss from himself in a letter which was delayed upon the
road three<span class="pagenum"><a id="page90" name="page90"></a>Pg 90</span> months. I was sincerely sorry for it, but in such cases
what are words?</p>

<p>"The villa you speak of is one at Este, which Mr. Hoppner
(Consul-general here) has transferred to me. I have taken it for
two years as a place of Villeggiatura. The situation is very
beautiful, indeed, among the Euganean hills, and the house very
fair. The vines are luxuriant to a great degree, and all the fruits
of the earth abundant. It is close to the old castle of the Estes,
or Guelphs, and within a few miles of Arqua, which I have visited
twice, and hope to visit often.</p>

<p>"Last summer (except an excursion to Rome) I passed upon the
Brenta. In Venice I winter, transporting my horses to the Lido,
bordering the Adriatic (where the fort is), so that I get a gallop
of some miles daily along the strip of beach which reaches to
Malamocco, when in health; but within these few weeks I have been
unwell. At present I am getting better. The Carnival was short, but
a good one. I don't go out much, except during the time of masques;
but there are one or two conversazioni, where I go regularly, just
to keep up the system; as I had letters to their givers; and they
are particular on such points; and now and then, though very
rarely, to the Governor's.</p>

<p>"It is a very good place for women. I like the dialect and their
manner very much. There is a <i>na&iuml;vet&eacute;</i> about them which is very
winning, and the romance of the place is a mighty adjunct; the <i>bel
sangue</i> is not, however, now amongst the <i>dame</i> or higher orders;
but all under <i>i fazzioli</i>, or kerchiefs<span class="pagenum"><a id="page91" name="page91"></a>Pg 91</span> (a white kind of veil
which the lower orders wear upon their heads);&mdash;the <i>vesta
zendale</i>, or old national female costume, is no more. The city,
however, is decaying daily, and does not gain in population.
However, I prefer it to any other in Italy; and here have I pitched
my staff, and here do I purpose to reside for the remainder of my
life, unless events, connected with business not to be transacted
out of England, compel me to return for that purpose; otherwise I
have few regrets, and no desires to visit it again for its own
sake. I shall probably be obliged to do so, to sign papers for my
affairs, and a proxy for the Whigs, and to see Mr. Waite, for I
can't find a good dentist here, and every two or three years one
ought to consult one. About seeing my children I must take my
chance. One I shall have sent here; and I shall be very happy to
see the legitimate one, when God pleases, which he perhaps will
some day or other. As for my mathematical * * *, I am as well
without her.</p>

<p>"Your account of your visit to Fonthill is very striking: could you
beg of <i>him</i> for <i>me</i> a copy in MS. of the remaining <i>Tales</i>?<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> I
think I deserve them, as a strenuous and public admirer of the
first one. I will return it when read, and make no ill use of the
copy, if granted. Murray would send me out any thing safely. If
ever I return to England, I should<span class="pagenum"><a id="page92" name="page92"></a>Pg 92</span> like very much to see the
author, with his permission. In the mean time, you could not oblige
me more than by obtaining me the perusal I request, in French or
English,&mdash;all's one for that, though I prefer Italian to either. I
have a French copy of Vathek which I bought at Lausanne. I can read
French with great pleasure and facility, though I neither speak nor
write it. Now Italian I <i>can</i> speak with some fluency, and write
sufficiently for my purposes, but I don't like their <i>modern</i> prose
at all; it is very heavy, and so different from Machiavelli.</p>

<p>"They say Francis is Junius;&mdash;I think it looks like it. I remember
meeting him at Earl Grey's at dinner. Has not he lately married a
young woman; and was not he Madame Talleyrand's <i>cavaliere
servente</i> in India years ago?</p>

<p>"I read my death in the papers, which was not true. I see they are
marrying the remaining singleness of the royal family. They have
brought out Fazio with great and deserved success at Covent Garden:
that's a good sign. I tried, during the directory, to have it done
at Drury Lane, but was overruled. If you think of coming into this
country, you will let me know perhaps beforehand. I suppose Moore
won't move. Rose is here. I saw him the other night at Madame
Albrizzi's; he talks of returning in May. My love to the Hollands.</p>

<p>"Ever, &amp;c.</p>

<p>"P.S. They have been crucifying Othello into an opera (<i>Otello</i>, by
Rossini): the music good, but lugubrious; but as for the words, all
the real scenes with Iago cut out, and the greatest nonsense
instead;<span class="pagenum"><a id="page93" name="page93"></a>Pg 93</span> the handkerchief turned into a <i>billet-doux</i>, and the

<p><b>LETTER 311. TO MR. MOORE.</b></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Venice, March 16. 1818.</p>

<p>"My dear Tom,</p>

<p>"Since my last, which I hope that you have received, I have had a
letter from our friend Samuel. He talks of Italy this summer&mdash;won't
you come with him? I don't know whether you would like our Italian
way of life or not.</p>

<p>"They are an odd people. The other day I was telling a girl, 'You
must not come to-morrow, because Margueritta is coming at such a
time,'&mdash;(they are both about five feet ten inches high, with great
black eyes and fine figures&mdash;fit to breed gladiators from&mdash;and I
had some difficulty to prevent a battle upon a rencontre once
before,)&mdash;'unless you promise to be friends, and'&mdash;the answer was
an interruption, by a declaration of war against the other, which
she said would be a 'Guerra di Candia.' Is it not odd, that the
lower order of Venetians should still allude proverbially to that
famous contest, so glorious and so fatal to the Republic?</p>

<p>"They have singular expressions, like all the Italians. For
example, 'Viscere'&mdash;as we would say, 'My love,' or 'My heart,' as
an expression of tenderness. Also, 'I would go for you into the
midst of a hundred <i>knives</i>.'&mdash;'<i>Mazza ben</i>,' excessive<span class="pagenum"><a id="page94" name="page94"></a>Pg 94</span>
attachment,&mdash;literally, 'I wish you well even to killing.' Then
they say (instead of our way, 'Do you think I would do you so much
harm?') 'Do you think I would <i>assassinate</i> you in such a
manner?'&mdash;'Tempo <i>perfido</i>,' bad weather; 'Strade <i>perfide</i>,' bad
roads,&mdash;with a thousand other allusions and metaphors, taken from
the state of society and habits in the middle ages.</p>

<p>"I am not so sure about <i>mazza</i>, whether it don't mean <i>massa</i>,
<i>i.e.</i> a great deal, a <i>mass</i>, instead of the interpretation I have
given it. But of the other phrases I am sure.</p>

<p>"Three o' th' clock&mdash;I must 'to bed, to bed, to bed,' as mother S *
* (that tragical friend of the mathematical * * *) says.</p>

<p>"Have you ever seen&mdash;I forget what or whom&mdash;no matter. They tell me
Lady Melbourne is very unwell. I shall be so sorry. She was my
greatest <i>friend</i>, of the feminine gender:&mdash;when I say 'friend,' I
mean <i>not</i> mistress, for that's the antipode. Tell me all about you
and every body&mdash;how Sam is&mdash;how you like your neighbours, the
Marquis and Marchesa, &amp;c. &amp;c.</p>

<p><b>LETTER 314. TO MR. MURRAY.</b></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Venice, April 12. 1818.</p>

<p>"This letter will be delivered by Signor Gioe. Bata. Missiaglia,
proprietor of the Apollo library, and the principal publisher and
bookseller now in Venice. He sets out for London with a view to
business and correspondence with the English booksellers: and it is
in the hope that it may be for your mutual advantage that I furnish
him with this letter of introduction to you. If you can be of use
to him, either by recommendation to others, or by any personal
attention on your own part, you will oblige him and gratify me. You
may also perhaps both be able to derive advantage, or establish
some mode of literary communication, pleasing to the public, and
beneficial to one another.</p>

<p>"At any rate, be civil to him for my sake, as well as for the
honour and glory of publishers and authors now and to come for
evermore.</p>

<p>"With him I also consign a great number of MS. letters written in
English, French, and Italian, by various English established in
Italy during the last<span class="pagenum"><a id="page98" name="page98"></a>Pg 98</span> century:&mdash;the names of the writers, Lord
Hervey, Lady M.W. Montague, (hers are but few&mdash;some billets-doux in
French to Algarotti, and one letter in English, Italian, and all
sorts of jargon, to the same,) Gray, the poet (one letter), Mason
(two or three), Garrick, Lord Chatham, David Hume, and many of
lesser note,&mdash;all addressed to Count Algarotti. Out of these, I
think, with discretion, an amusing miscellaneous volume of letters
might be extracted, provided some good editor were disposed to
undertake the selection, and preface, and a few notes, &amp;c.</p>

<p>"The proprietor of these is a friend of mine, <i>Dr. Aglietti</i>,&mdash;a
great name in Italy,&mdash;and if you are disposed to publish, it will
be for <i>his benefit</i>, and it is to and for him that you will name a
price, if you take upon you the work. <i>I</i> would <i>edite</i> it myself,
but am too far off, and too lazy to undertake it; but I wish that
it could be done. The letters of Lord Hervey, in Mr. Rose's<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a>
opinion and mine, are good;<span class="pagenum"><a id="page99" name="page99"></a>Pg 99</span> and the <i>short</i> French love letters
<i>certainly</i> are Lady M.W. Montague's&mdash;the <i>French</i> not good, but
the sentiments beautiful. Gray's letter good; and Mason's
tolerable. The whole correspondence must be <i>well weeded</i>; but this
being done, a small and pretty popular volume might be made of
it.&mdash;There are many ministers' letters&mdash;Gray, the ambassador at
Naples, Horace Mann, and others of the same kind of animal.</p>

<p>"I thought of a preface, defending Lord Hervey against Pope's
attack, but Pope&mdash;<i>quoad</i> Pope, the poet&mdash;against all the world, in
the unjustifiable attempts begun by Warton and carried on at this
day by the new school of critics and scribblers, who think
themselves poets because they do <i>not</i> write like Pope. I have no
patience with such cursed humbug and bad taste; your whole
generation are not worth a Canto of the Rape of the Lock, or the
Essay on Man, or the Dunciad, or 'any thing that is his.'&mdash;But it
is three in the matin, and I must go to bed. Yours alway," &amp;c.</p></div>

<p><b>LETTER 315. TO MR. MURRAY.</b></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Venice, April 17. 1818.</p>

<p>"A few days ago, I wrote to you a letter, requesting you to desire
Hanson to desire his messenger to<span class="pagenum"><a id="page100" name="page100"></a>Pg 100</span> come on from Geneva to Venice,
because I won't go from Venice to Geneva; and if this is not done,
the messenger may be damned, with him who mis-sent him. Pray
reiterate my request.</p>

<p>"With the proofs returned, I sent two additional stanzas for Canto
fourth: did they arrive?</p>

<p>"Your Monthly reviewer has made a mistake: <i>Cavaliere</i>, alone, is
well enough; but '<i>Cavalier' servente</i>' has always the <i>e</i> mute in
conversation, and omitted in writing; so that it is not for the
sake of metre; and pray let Griffiths know this, with my
compliments. I humbly conjecture that I know as much of Italian
society and language as any of his people; but, to make assurance
doubly sure, I asked, at the Countess Benzona's last night, the
question of more than one person in <i>the office</i>, and of these
'cavalieri serventi' (in the plural, recollect) I found that they
all accorded in pronouncing for 'cavalier' servente' in the
<i>singular</i> number. I wish Mr. * * * * (or whoever Griffiths'
scribbler may be) would not talk of what he don't understand. Such
fellows are not fit to be intrusted with Italian, even in a
quotation.</p>

<p>"Did you receive two additional stanzas, to be inserted towards the
close of Canto fourth? Respond, that (if not) they may be sent.</p>

<p>"Tell Mr. * * and Mr. Hanson that they may as well expect Geneva to
come to me, as that I should go to Geneva. The messenger may go on
or return, as he pleases; I won't stir: and I look upon it as a
piece of singular absurdity in those who know me imagining that I
should;&mdash;not to say <i>malice</i>, in<span class="pagenum"><a id="page101" name="page101"></a>Pg 101</span> attempting unnecessary torture.
If, on the occasion, my interests should suffer, it is their

feel for the death of Lady Melbourne, the best, and kindest, and
ablest female I ever knew, old or young. But 'I have supped full of
horrors,' and events of this kind have only a kind of numbness
worse than pain,&mdash;like a violent blow on the elbow or the head.
There is one link less between England and myself.</p>

<p>"Now to business. I presented you with Beppo, as part of the

for the same, and intending to eke you out in case of public
caprice or my own poetical failure. If you choose to suppress it

But recollect it is not to be published in a <i>garbled</i> or
<i>mutilated</i> state. I reserve to my friends and myself the right of
correcting the press;&mdash;if the publication continue, it is to
continue in its present form.</p>

<p>"As Mr. * * says that he did not write this letter, &amp;c. I am ready

refer to Mr. * * * *, who can inform you how sincerely I erred on

it to him with my verbal comments thereupon. As to 'Beppo,' I will
not alter or suppress a syllable for any man's pleasure but my own.</p>

<p>"You may tell them this; and add, that nothing but force or
necessity shall stir me one step towards places to which they would
wring me.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Palazzo Mocenigo, Canal Grande,</p>

<p>"Venice, June 1. 1818.</p>

<p>"Your letter is almost the only news, as yet, of Canto fourth, and
it has by no means settled its fate,&mdash;at least, does not tell me
how the 'Poeshie' has been received by the public. But I suspect,
no great things,&mdash;firstly, from Murray's 'horrid stillness;'
secondly, from what you say about the stanzas running into each
other<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a>, which I take <i>not</i> to be <i>yours</i>, but a notion you have
been dinned with among the Blues. The fact is, that the terza rima
of the Italians, which always <i>runs</i> on and in, may have led me
into experiments, and carelessness into conceit&mdash;or conceit into
carelessness&mdash;in either of which events failure will be probable,
and my fair woman,<span class="pagenum"><a id="page103" name="page103"></a>Pg 103</span> 'superne,' end in a fish; so that Childe Harold
will be like the mermaid, my family crest, with the fourth Canto
for a tail thereunto. I won't quarrel with the public, however, for
the 'Bulgars' are generally right; and if I miss now, I may hit
another time:&mdash;and so, the 'gods give us joy.'</p>

<p>"You like Beppo, that's right. I have not had the Fudges yet, but
live in hopes. I need not say that your successes are mine. By the
way, Lydia White is here, and has just borrowed my copy of 'Lalla
Rookh.'</p>

<p>"Hunt's letter is probably the exact piece of vulgar coxcombry you
might expect from his situation. He is a good man, with some
poetical elements in his chaos; but spoilt by the Christ-Church
Hospital and a Sunday newspaper,&mdash;to say nothing of the Surrey
gaol, which conceited him into a martyr. But he is a good man. When
I saw 'Rimini' in MS., I told him that I deemed it good poetry at
bottom, disfigured only by a strange style. His answer was, that
his style was a system, or <i>upon system</i>, or some such cant; and,
when a man talks of system, his case is hopeless: so I said no more
to him, and very little to any one else.</p>

<p>"He believes his trash of vulgar phrases tortured into compound
barbarisms to be <i>old</i> English; and we may say of it as Aimwell
says of Captain Gibbet's regiment, when the Captain calls it an
'old corps,'&mdash;'the <i>oldest</i> in Europe, if I may judge by your
uniform.' He sent out his 'Foliage' by Percy Shelley * * *, and, of
all the ineffable Centaurs that were ever begotten by Self-love
upon a Night-mare, I think<span class="pagenum"><a id="page104" name="page104"></a>Pg 104</span> this monstrous Sagittary the most
prodigious. <i>He</i> (Leigh H.) is an honest charlatan, who has
persuaded himself into a belief of his own impostures, and talks
Punch in pure simplicity of heart, taking himself (as poor
Fitzgerald said of <i>himself</i> in the Morning Post) for <i>Vates</i> in
both senses, or nonsenses, of the word. Did you look at the
translations of his own which he prefers to Pope and Cowper, and
says so?&mdash;Did you read his skimble-skamble about * * being at the
head of his own <i>profession</i>, in the <i>eyes</i> of <i>those</i> who followed
it? I thought that poetry was an <i>art</i>, or an <i>attribute</i>, and not
a <i>profession</i>;&mdash;but be it one, is that * * * * * * at the head of
<i>your</i> profession in <i>your</i> eyes? I'll be curst if he is of <i>mine</i>,
or ever shall be. He is the only one of us (but of us he is not)
whose coronation I would oppose. Let them take Scott, Campbell,
Crabbe, or you, or me, or any of the living, and throne him;&mdash;but
not this new Jacob Behmen, this * * * * * * whose pride might have
kept him true, even had his principles turned as perverted as his
<i>soi-disant</i> poetry.</p>

all the Masters Hunt;&mdash;a good husband&mdash;see his Sonnet to Mrs.
Hunt;&mdash;a good friend&mdash;see his Epistles to different people;&mdash;and a
great coxcomb and a very vulgar person in every thing about him.

<i>Savage</i>. Recollect, however, that the life of such a man may be
made far more amusing than if he had been a Wilberforce;&mdash;and this
without offending the living, or insulting the dead. The Whigs
abuse him; however, he never left them, and such blunderers deserve
neither credit nor compassion. As for his creditors,&mdash;remember,
Sheridan <i>never had</i> a shilling, and was thrown, with great powers
and passions, into the thick of the world, and placed upon the
pinnacle of success, with no other external means to support him in
his elevation. Did Fox * * * <i>pay his</i> debts?&mdash;or did Sheridan take
a subscription? Was the * *'s drunkenness more excusable than his?
Were his intrigues more notorious than those of all his
contemporaries? and is his memory to be blasted, and theirs
respected? Don't let yourself be led away by clamour, but compare
him with the coalitioner Fox, and the pensioner Burke, as a man of
principle, and with ten hundred thousand in personal views, and
with none in talent, for he beat them all <i>out</i> and <i>out</i>. Without
means, without connection, without character, (which might be false
at first, and make him mad afterwards from desperation,) he beat
them all, in all he ever attempted. But alas, poor human nature!
Good night&mdash;or rather, morning. It is four, and the dawn gleams
over the Grand Canal,<span class="pagenum"><a id="page106" name="page106"></a>Pg 106</span> and unshadows the Rialto. I must to bed; up

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>During the greater part of the period which this last series of letters
comprises, he had continued to occupy the same lodgings in an extremely
narrow street called the Spezieria, at the house of the linen-draper, to
whose lady he devoted so much of his thoughts. That he was, for the
time, attached to this person,&mdash;as far as a passion so transient can
deserve the name of attachment,&mdash;is evident from his whole conduct. The
language of his letters shows sufficiently how much the novelty of this
foreign tie had caught his fancy; and to the Venetians, among whom such
arrangements are mere matters of course, the assiduity with which he
attended his Signora to the theatre, and the ridottos, was a subject of
much amusement. It was with difficulty, indeed, that he could be
prevailed upon to absent himself from her so long as to admit of that
hasty visit to the Immortal City, out of which one of his own noblest
titles to immortality sprung; and having, in the space of a few weeks,
drunk in more inspiration from all he saw than, in a less excited state,
possibly, he might have imbibed in years, he again hurried back, without
extending his journey to Naples,&mdash;having written to the fair Marianna to
meet him at some distance from Venice.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page107" name="page107"></a>Pg 107</span></p>

<p>Besides some seasonable acts of liberality to the husband, who had, it
seems, failed in trade, he also presented to the lady herself a handsome
set of diamonds; and there is an anecdote related in reference to this
gift, which shows the exceeding easiness and forbearance of his
disposition towards those who had acquired any hold on his heart. A
casket, which was for sale, being one day offered to him, he was not a
little surprised on discovering them to be the same jewels which he had,
not long before, presented to his fair favourite, and which had, by some
unromantic means, found their way back into the market. Without
enquiring, however, any further into the circumstances, he generously
repurchased the casket and presented it to the lady once more,
good-humouredly taxing her with the very little estimation in which, as
it appeared, she held his presents.</p>

<p>To whatever extent this unsentimental incident may have had a share in
dispelling the romance of his passion, it is certain that, before the
expiration of the first twelvemonth, he began to find his lodgings in
the Spezieria inconvenient, and accordingly entered into treaty with
Count Gritti for his Palace on the Grand Canal,&mdash;engaging to give for
it, what is considered, I believe, a large rent in Venice, 200 louis a
year. On finding, however, that, in the counterpart of the lease brought
for his signature, a new clause had been introduced, prohibiting him not
only from underletting the house, in case he should leave Venice, but
from even allowing any of his own friends to occupy it during his
occasional absence,<span class="pagenum"><a id="page108" name="page108"></a>Pg 108</span> he declined closing on such terms; and resenting so
material a departure from the original engagement, declared in society,
that he would have no objection to give the same rent, though
acknowledged to be exorbitant, for any other palace in Venice, however
inferior, in all respects, to Count Gritti's. After such an
announcement, he was not likely to remain long unhoused; and the
Countess Mocenigo having offered him one of her three Palazzi, on the
Grand Canal, he removed to this house in the summer of the present year,
and continued to occupy it during the remainder of his stay in Venice.</p>

<p>Highly censurable, in point of morality and decorum, as was his course
of life while under the roof of Madame * *, it was (with pain I am
forced to confess) venial in comparison with the strange, headlong
career of licence to which, when weaned from that connection, he so
unrestrainedly and, it may be added, defyingly abandoned himself. Of the
state of his mind on leaving England I have already endeavoured to
convey some idea, and, among the feelings that went to make up that
self-centred spirit of resistance which he then opposed to his fate, was
an indignant scorn of his own countrymen for the wrongs he thought they
had done him. For a time, the kindly sentiments which he still harboured
towards Lady Byron, and a sort of vague hope, perhaps, that all would
yet come right again, kept his mind in a mood somewhat more softened and
docile, as well as sufficiently under the influence of English opinion
to prevent his breaking<span class="pagenum"><a id="page109" name="page109"></a>Pg 109</span> out into such open rebellion against it, as he
unluckily did afterwards.</p>

<p>By the failure of the attempted mediation with Lady Byron, his last link
with home was severed; while, notwithstanding the quiet and unobtrusive
life which he had led at Geneva, there was as yet, he found, no
cessation of the slanderous warfare against his character;&mdash;the same
busy and misrepresenting spirit which had tracked his every step at home
having, with no less malicious watchfulness, dogged him into exile. To
this persuasion, for which he had but too much grounds, was added all
that an imagination like his could lend to truth,&mdash;all that he was left
to interpret, in his own way, of the absent and the silent,&mdash;till, at
length, arming himself against fancied enemies and wrongs, and, with the
condition (as it seemed to him) of an outlaw, assuming also the
desperation, he resolved, as his countrymen would not do justice to the
better parts of his nature, to have, at least, the perverse satisfaction
of braving and shocking them with the worst. It is to this feeling, I am
convinced, far more than to any depraved taste for such a course of
life, that the extravagances to which he now, for a short time, gave
loose, are to be attributed. The exciting effect, indeed, of this mode
of existence while it lasted, both upon his spirits and his genius,&mdash;so
like what, as he himself tells us, was always produced in him by a state
of contest and defiance,&mdash;showed how much of this latter feeling must
have been mixed with his excesses. The altered character too, of his
letters in this respect cannot fail,<span class="pagenum"><a id="page110" name="page110"></a>Pg 110</span> I think, to be remarked by the
reader,&mdash;there being, with an evident increase of intellectual vigour, a
tone of violence and bravado breaking out in them continually, which
marks the high pitch of re-action to which he had now wound up his
temper.</p>

<p>In fact, so far from the powers of his intellect being at all weakened
or dissipated by these irregularities, he was, perhaps, at no time of
his life, so actively in the full possession of all its energies; and
his friend Shelley, who went to Venice, at this period, to see him<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a>,
used to say, that all he observed of<span class="pagenum"><a id="page111" name="page111"></a>Pg 111</span> the workings of Byron's mind,
during his visit, gave him a far higher idea of its powers than he had
ever before entertained. It was, indeed, then that Shelley sketched out,
and chiefly wrote, his poem of "Julian and Maddalo," in the latter of
which personages he has so picturesquely shadowed forth his noble
friend<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a>; and the allusions to "the Swan of Albion," in his "Lines
written among the Euganean Hills," were also, I understand, the result
of the same access of admiration and enthusiasm.</p>

<p>In speaking of the Venetian women, in one of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="page112" name="page112"></a>Pg 112</span> preceding letters,
Lord Byron, it will be recollected, remarks, that the beauty for which
they were once so celebrated is no longer now to be found among the
"Dame," or higher orders, but all under the "fazzioli," or kerchiefs, of
the lower. It was, unluckily, among these latter specimens of the "bel
sangue" of Venice that he now, by a suddenness of descent in the scale
of refinement, for which nothing but the present wayward state of his
mind can account, chose to select the companions of his disengaged
hours;&mdash;and an additional proof that, in this short, daring career of
libertinism, he was but desperately seeking relief for a wronged and
mortified spirit, and</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"What to us seem'd guilt might be but woe,"&mdash;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>is that, more than once, of an evening, when his house has been in the
possession of such visitants, he has been known to hurry away in his
gondola, and pass the greater part of the night upon the water, as if
hating to return to his home. It is, indeed, certain, that to this least
defensible portion of his whole life he always looked back, during the
short remainder of it, with painful self-reproach; and among the causes
of the detestation which he afterwards felt for Venice, this
recollection of the excesses to which he had there abandoned himself was
not the least prominent.</p>

<p>The most distinguished and, at last, the reigning favourite of all this
unworthy Harem was a woman named Margarita Cogni, who has been already
men<span class="pagenum"><a id="page113" name="page113"></a>Pg 113</span>tioned in one of these letters, and who, from the trade of her
husband, was known by the title of the Fornarina. A portrait of this
handsome virago, drawn by Harlowe when at Venice, having fallen into the
hands of one of Lord Byron's friends after the death of that artist, the
noble poet, on being applied to for some particulars of his heroine,
wrote a long letter on the subject, from which the following are
extracts:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Since you desire the story of Margarita Cogni, you shall be told
it, though it may be lengthy.</p>

<p>"Her face is the fine Venetian cast of the old time; her figure,
though perhaps too tall, is not less fine&mdash;and taken altogether in
the national dress.</p>

<p>"In the summer of 1817, * * * * and myself were sauntering on
horseback along the Brenta one evening, when, amongst a group of
peasants, we remarked two girls as the prettiest we had seen for
some time. About this period, there had been great distress in the
country, and I had a little relieved some of the people. Generosity
makes a great figure at very little cost in Venetian livres, and
mine had probably been exaggerated as an Englishman's. Whether they
remarked us looking at them or no, I know not; but one of them
called out to me in Venetian, 'Why do not you, who relieve others,
think of us also?' I turned round and answered her&mdash;'Cara, tu sei
troppo bella e giovane per aver' bisogna del' soccorso mio.' She
answered, 'If you saw my hut and my food, you would not say so.'
All this passed half jestingly, and I saw no more of her for some
days.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page114" name="page114"></a>Pg 114</span></p>

<p>"A few evenings after, we met with these two girls again, and they
addressed us more seriously, assuring us of the truth of their
statement. They were cousins; Margarita married, the other single.
As I doubted still of the circumstances, I took the business in a
different light, and made an appointment with them for the next
evening. In short, in a few evenings we arranged our affairs, and
for a long space of time she was the only one who preserved over me
an ascendency which was often disputed, and never impaired.</p>

<p>"The reasons of this were, firstly, her person;&mdash;very dark, tall,
the Venetian face, very fine black eyes. She was two-and-twenty
years old, * * * She was, besides, a thorough Venetian in her
dialect, in her thoughts, in her countenance, in every thing, with
all their <i>na&iuml;vet&eacute;</i> and pantaloon humour. Besides, she could
neither read nor write, and could not plague me with
letters,&mdash;except twice that she paid sixpence to a public scribe,
under the piazza, to make a letter for her, upon some occasion when
I was ill and could not see her. In other respects, she was
somewhat fierce and 'prepotente,' that is, over-bearing, and used
to walk in whenever it suited her, with no very great regard to
time, place, nor persons; and if she found any women in her way,
she knocked them down.</p>

<p>"When I first knew her, I was in 'relazione' (liaison) with la
Signora * *, who was silly enough one evening at Dolo, accompanied
by some of her female friends, to threaten her; for the gossips of
the villeggiatura had already found out, by the<span class="pagenum"><a id="page115" name="page115"></a>Pg 115</span> neighing of my
horse one evening, that I used to 'ride late in the night' to meet
the Fornarina. Margarita threw back her veil (fazziolo), and
replied in very explicit Venetian, '<i>You</i> are <i>not</i> his <i>wife</i>: <i>I</i>
am <i>not</i> his <i>wife</i>: you are his Donna, and <i>I</i> am his <i>Donna</i>:
your husband is a <i>becco</i>, and mine is another. For the rest, what
<i>right</i> have you to reproach me? If he prefers me to you, is it my
fault? If you wish to secure him, tie him to your
petticoat-string.&mdash;But do not think to speak to me without a reply,
because you happen to be richer than I am.' Having delivered this
pretty piece of eloquence (which I translate as it was related to
me by a bystander), she went on her way, leaving a numerous
audience with Madame * *, to ponder at her leisure on the dialogue
between them.</p>

<p>"When I came to Venice for the winter, she followed; and as she
found herself out to be a favourite, she came to me pretty often.
But she had inordinate self-love, and was not tolerant of other
women. At the 'Cavalchina,' the masked ball on the last night of
the carnival, where all the world goes, she snatched off the mask
of Madame Contarini, a lady noble by birth, and decent in conduct,
for no other reason, but because she happened to be leaning on my
arm. You may suppose what a cursed noise this made; but this is
only one of her pranks.</p>

<p>"At last she quarrelled with her husband, and one evening ran away
to my house. I told her this would not do: she said she would lie
in the street, but not go back to him; that he beat her, (the
gentle tigress!) spent her money, and scandalously neglected her.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page116" name="page116"></a>Pg 116</span>
As it was midnight I let her stay, and next day there was no moving
her at all. Her husband came, roaring and crying, and entreating
her to come back:&mdash;<i>not</i> she! He then applied to the police, and
they applied to me: I told them and her husband to <i>take</i> her; I
did not want her; she had come, and I could not fling her out of
the window; but they might conduct her through that or the door if
they chose it. She went before the commissary, but was obliged to
return with that 'becco ettico,' as she called the poor man, who
had a phthisic. In a few days she ran away again. After a precious
piece of work, she fixed herself in my house, really and truly
without my consent; but, owing to my indolence, and not being able
to keep my countenance, for if I began in a rage, she always
finished by making me laugh with some Venetian pantaloonery or
another; and the gipsy knew this well enough, as well as her other
powers of persuasion, and exerted them with the usual tact and
success of all she-things; high and low, they are all alike for
that.</p>

<p>"Madame Benzoni also took her under her protection, and then her
head turned. She was always in extremes, either crying or laughing,
and so fierce when angered, that she was the terror of men, women,
and children&mdash;for she had the strength of an Amazon, with the
temper of Medea. She was a fine animal, but quite untameable. <i>I</i>
was the only person that could at all keep her in any order, and
when she saw me really angry (which they tell me is a savage
sight), she subsided. But she had a thousand fooleries. In her
fazziolo, the dress of<span class="pagenum"><a id="page117" name="page117"></a>Pg 117</span> the lower orders, she looked beautiful;
but, alas! she longed for a hat and feathers; and all I could say
or do (and I said much) could not prevent this travestie. I put the
first into the fire; but I got tired of burning them, before she
did of buying them, so that she made herself a figure&mdash;for they did
not at all become her.</p>

<p>"Then she would have her gowns with a <i>tail</i>&mdash;like a lady,
forsooth; nothing would serve her but 'l'abita colla <i>coua</i>,' or
<i>cua</i>, (that is the Venetian for 'la cola,' the tail or train,) and
as her cursed pronunciation of the word made me laugh, there was an
end of all controversy, and she dragged this diabolical tail after
her every where.</p>

<p>"In the mean time, she beat the women and stopped my letters. I
found her one day pondering over one. She used to try to find out
by their shape whether they were feminine or no; and she used to
lament her ignorance, and actually studied her alphabet, on purpose
(as she declared) to open all letters addressed to me and read
their contents.</p>

<p>"I must not omit to do justice to her housekeeping qualities. After
she came into my house as 'donna di governo,' the expenses were
reduced to less than half, and every body did their duty
better&mdash;the apartments were kept in order, and every thing and
every body else, except herself.</p>

<p>"That she had a sufficient regard for me in her wild way, I had
many reasons to believe. I will mention one. In the autumn, one
day, going to the Lido with my gondoliers, we were overtaken by a
heavy squall, and the gondola put in peril&mdash;hats<span class="pagenum"><a id="page118" name="page118"></a>Pg 118</span> blown away, boat
filling, oar lost, tumbling sea, thunder, rain in torrents, night
coming, and wind unceasing. On our return, after a tight struggle,
I found her on the open steps of the Mocenigo palace, on the Grand
Canal, with her great black eyes flashing through her tears, and
the long dark hair, which was streaming, drenched with rain, over
her brows and breast. She was perfectly exposed to the storm; and
the wind blowing her hair and dress about her thin tall figure, and
the lightning flashing round her, and the waves rolling at her
feet, made her look like Medea alighted from her chariot, or the
Sibyl of the tempest that was rolling around her, the only living
thing within hail at that moment except ourselves. On seeing me
safe, she did not wait to greet me, as might have been expected,
but calling out to me&mdash;'Ah! can' della Madonna, xe esto il tempo
per andar' al' Lido?' (Ah! dog of the Virgin, is this a time to go
to Lido?) ran into the house, and solaced herself with scolding the
boatmen for not foreseeing the 'temporale.' I am told by the
servants that she had only been prevented from coming in a boat to
look after me, by the refusal of all the gondoliers of the canal to
put out into the harbour in such a moment; and that then she sat
down on the steps in all the thickest of the squall, and would
neither be removed nor comforted. Her joy at seeing me again was
moderately mixed with ferocity, and gave me the idea of a tigress
over her recovered cubs.</p>

<p>"But her reign drew near a close. She became quite ungovernable
some months after, and a con<span class="pagenum"><a id="page119" name="page119"></a>Pg 119</span>currence of complaints, some true, and
many false&mdash;'a favourite has no friends'&mdash;determined me to part
with her. I told her quietly that she must return home, (she had
acquired a sufficient provision for herself and mother, &amp;c. in my
service,) and she refused to quit the house. I was firm, and she
went threatening knives and revenge. I told her that I had seen
knives drawn before her time, and that if she chose to begin, there
was a knife, and fork also, at her service on the table, and that
intimidation would not do. The next day, while I was at dinner, she
walked in, (having broken open a glass door that led from the hall
below to the staircase, by way of prologue,) and advancing straight
up to the table, snatched the knife from my hand, cutting me
slightly in the thumb in the operation. Whether she meant to use
this against herself or me, I know not&mdash;probably against
neither&mdash;but Fletcher seized her by the arms, and disarmed her. I
then called my boatmen, and desired them to get the gondola ready,
and conduct her to her own house again, seeing carefully that she
did herself no mischief by the way. She seemed quite quiet, and
walked down stairs. I resumed my dinner.</p>

<p>"We heard a great noise, and went out, and met them on the
staircase, carrying her up stairs. She had thrown herself into the
canal. That she intended to destroy herself, I do not believe; but
when we consider the fear women and men who can't swim have of deep
or even of shallow water, (and the Venetians in particular, though
they live on the waves,) and that it was also night, and dark, and
very cold,<span class="pagenum"><a id="page120" name="page120"></a>Pg 120</span> it shows that she had a devilish spirit of some sort
within her. They had got her out without much difficulty or damage,
excepting the salt water she had swallowed, and the wetting she had
undergone.</p>

<p>"I foresaw her intention to refix herself, and sent for a surgeon,
enquiring how many hours it would require to restore her from her
agitation; and he named the time. I then said, 'I give you that
time, and more if you require it; but at the expiration of this
prescribed period, if <i>she</i> does not leave the house, <i>I</i> will.'</p>

<p>"All my people were consternated. They had always been frightened
at her, and were now paralysed: they wanted me to apply to the
police, to guard myself, &amp;c. &amp;c. like a pack of snivelling servile
boobies as they were. I did nothing of the kind, thinking that I
might as well end that way as another; besides, I had been used to
savage women, and knew their ways.</p>

<p>"I had her sent home quietly after her recovery, and never saw her
since, except twice at the opera, at a distance amongst the
audience. She made many attempts to return, but no more violent
ones. And this is the story of Margarita Cogni, as far as it
relates to me.</p>

<p>"I forgot to mention that she was very devout, and would cross
herself if she heard the prayer time strike.</p>

<p>"She was quick in reply; as, for instance&mdash;One day when she had
made me very angry with beating somebody or other, I called her a
<i>cow</i> (<i>cow</i>, in Italian, is a sad affront). I called her 'Vacca.'
She turned<span class="pagenum"><a id="page121" name="page121"></a>Pg 121</span> round, courtesied, and answered, 'Vacca <i>tua</i>,
'celenza' (<i>i.e.</i> eccelenza). '<i>Your</i> cow, please your Excellency.'
In short, she was, as I said before, a very fine animal, of
considerable beauty and energy, with many good and several amusing
qualities, but wild as a witch and fierce as a demon. She used to
boast publicly of her ascendency over me, contrasting it with that
of other women, and assigning for it sundry reasons. True it was,
that they all tried to get her away, and no one succeeded till her
own absurdity helped them.</p>

<p>"I omitted to tell you her answer, when I reproached her for
snatching Madame Contarini's mask at the Cavalchina. I represented
to her that she was a lady of high birth, 'una Dama,' &amp;c. She
answered, 'Se ella &egrave; dama <i>mi</i> (<i>io</i>) son Veneziana;'&mdash;'If she is a
lady, I am a Venetian.' This would have been fine a hundred years
ago, the pride of the nation rising up against the pride of
aristocracy: but, alas! Venice, and her people, and her nobles, are
alike returning fast to the ocean; and where there is no
independence, there can be no real self-respect. I believe that I
mistook or mis-stated one of her phrases in my letter; it should
have been&mdash;'Can' della Madonna cosa vus' tu? esto non &eacute; tempo per
andar' a Lido?'"</p></div>

<p>It was at this time, as we shall see by the letters I am about to
produce, and as the features, indeed, of the progeny itself would but
too plainly indicate, that he conceived, and wrote some part of, his
poem of 'Don Juan;'&mdash;and never did pages more<span class="pagenum"><a id="page122" name="page122"></a>Pg 122</span> faithfully and, in many
respects, lamentably, reflect every variety of feeling, and whim, and
passion that, like the wrack of autumn, swept across the author's mind
in writing them. Nothing less, indeed, than that singular combination of
attributes, which existed and were in full activity in his mind at this
moment, could have suggested, or been capable of, the execution of such
a work. The cool shrewdness of age, with the vivacity and glowing
temperament of youth,&mdash;the wit of a Voltaire, with the sensibility of a
Rousseau,&mdash;the minute, practical knowledge of the man of society, with
the abstract and self-contemplative spirit of the poet,&mdash;a
susceptibility of all that is grandest and most affecting in human
virtue, with a deep, withering experience of all that is most fatal to
it,&mdash;the two extremes, in short, of man's mixed and inconsistent nature,
now rankly smelling of earth, now breathing of heaven,&mdash;such was the
strange assemblage of contrary elements, all meeting together in the
same mind, and all brought to bear, in turn, upon the same task, from
which alone could have sprung this extraordinary poem,&mdash;the most
powerful and, in many respects, painful display of the versatility of
genius that has ever been left for succeeding ages to wonder at and
deplore.</p>

<p>I shall now proceed with his correspondence,&mdash;having thought some of the

of what he will find in these letters, but to account to him for much

<p><b>LETTER 318. TO MR. MURRAY.</b></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Venice, June 18. 1818.</p>

<p>"Business and the utter and inexplicable silence of all my
correspondents renders me impatient and troublesome. I wrote to Mr.
Hanson for a balance which is (or ought to be) in his hands;&mdash;no

months ago, and instead of him, I received a requisition to proceed
to Geneva, which (from * *, who knows my wishes and opinions about
approaching England) could only be irony or insult.</p>

<p>"I must, therefore, trouble <i>you</i> to pay into my bankers'
<i>immediately</i> whatever sum or sums you can make it convenient to do
on our agreement; otherwise, I shall be put to the <i>severest</i> and
most immediate inconvenience; and this at a time when, by every
rational prospect and calculation, I ought to be in the receipt of
considerable sums. Pray do not neglect this; you have no idea to
what inconvenience you will otherwise put me. * * had some absurd
notion about the disposal of this money in annuity (or God knows
what), which I merely listened to when he was here to avoid
squabbles and sermons; but I have occasion for the principal, and
had never any serious idea of appropriating it otherwise than to
answer my personal expenses. Hobhouse's wish is, if possible, to
force me back to England<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a>: he will not succeed; and if he did, I
would not stay. I hate the country, and like this; and all foolish
op<span class="pagenum"><a id="page124" name="page124"></a>Pg 124</span>position, of course, merely adds to the feeling. <i>Your</i> silence
makes me doubt the success of Canto fourth. If it has failed, I
will make such deduction as you think proper and fair from the
original agreement; but I could wish whatever is to be paid were
remitted to me, without delay, through the usual channel, by course
of post.</p>

<p>"When I tell you that I have not heard a word from England since
very early in May, I have made the eulogium of my friends, or the
persons who call themselves so, since I have written so often and
in the greatest anxiety. Thank God, the longer I am absent, the
less cause I see for regretting the country or its living contents.
I am yours," &amp;c.</p></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Venice, July 10. 1818.</p>

<p>"I have received your letter and the credit from Morlands, &amp;c. for
whom I have also drawn upon you at sixty days' sight for the
remainder, according to your proposition.</p>

<p>"I am still waiting in Venice, in expectancy of the arrival of
Hanson's clerk. What can detain him, I do not know; but I trust
that Mr. Hobhouse, and Mr. Kinnaird, when their political fit is
abated, will take the trouble to enquire and expedite him, as I
have nearly a hundred thousand pounds depending upon the completion
of the sale and the signature of the papers.</p>

<p>"The draft on you is drawn up by Siri and Will<span class="pagenum"><a id="page125" name="page125"></a>Pg 125</span>halm. I hope that
the form is correct. I signed it two or three days ago, desiring
them to forward it to Messrs. Morland and Ransom.</p>

<p>"Your projected editions for November had better be postponed, as I
have some things in project, or preparation, that may be of use to
you, though not very important in themselves. I have completed an
Ode on Venice, and have two Stories, one serious and one ludicrous
(&agrave; la Beppo), not yet finished, and in no hurry to be so.</p>

<p>"You talk of the letter to Hobhouse being much admired, and speak
of prose. I think of writing (for your full edition) some Memoirs
of my life, to prefix to them, upon the same model (though far
enough, I fear, from reaching it) of Gifford, Hume, &amp;c.; and this
without any intention of making disclosures or remarks upon living
people, which would be unpleasant to them: but I think it might be
done, and well done. However, this is to be considered. I have
<i>materials</i> in plenty, but the greater part of them could not be
used by <i>me</i>, nor for these hundred years to come. However, there
is enough without these, and merely as a literary man, to make a
preface for such an edition as you meditate. But this is by the
way: I have not made up my mind.</p>

<p>"I enclose you a <i>note</i> on the subject of '<i>Parisina</i>,' which
Hobhouse can dress for you. It is an extract of particulars from a
history of Ferrara.</p>

<p>"I suppose that Aglietti will take whatever you offer, but till his
return from Vienna I can make him no proposal; nor, indeed, have
you authorised me to do so. The three French notes <i>are</i> by Lady
Mary; also another half-English-French-Italian. They are very
pretty and passionate; it is a pity that a piece of one of them is
lost. Algarotti seems to have treated her ill; but she was much his
senior, and all women are used ill&mdash;or say so, whether they are or
not.</p>

<p>"I shall be glad of your books and powders. I am still in waiting
for Hanson's clerk, but luckily not at Geneva. All my good friends
wrote to me to hasten <i>there</i> to meet him, but not one had the good
sense or the good nature, to write afterwards to tell me that it
would be time and a journey thrown away, as he could not set off
for some months after the period appointed. If I <i>had</i> taken the
journey on the general suggestion, I never would have spoken again
to one of you as long as I existed. I have written to request Mr.
Kinnaird, when the foam of his politics is wiped away, to extract a
positive answer from that * * * *, and not to keep me in a state of
suspense upon the subject. I hope that Kinnaird, who has my power
of attorney, keeps a look-out upon the gentleman, which is the more
necessary, as I have a great dislike to the idea of coming over to
look after him myself.</p>

<p>"I have several things begun, verse and prose,<span class="pagenum"><a id="page127" name="page127"></a>Pg 127</span> but none in much
forwardness. I have written some six or seven sheets of a Life,
which I mean to continue, and send you when finished. It may
perhaps serve for your projected editions. If you would tell me
exactly (for I know nothing, and have no correspondents except on
business) the state of the reception of our late publications, and
the feeling upon them, without consulting any delicacies (I am too
seasoned to require them), I should know how and in what manner to
proceed. I should not like to give them too much, which may
probably have been the case already; but, as I tell you, I know
nothing.</p>

<p>"I once wrote from the fulness of my mind and the love of fame,
(not as an <i>end</i>, but as a <i>means</i>, to obtain that influence over
men's minds which is power in itself and in its consequences,) and
now from habit and from avarice; so that the effect may probably be
as different as the inspiration. I have the same facility, and
indeed necessity, of composition, to avoid idleness (though
idleness in a hot country is a pleasure), but a much greater
indifference to what is to become of it, after it has served my
immediate purpose. However, I should on no account like to&mdash;but I
won't go on, like the Archbishop of Granada, as I am very sure that
you dread the fate of Gil Blas, and with good reason. Yours, &amp;c.</p>

<p>"P.S. I have written some very savage letters to Mr. Hobhouse,
Kinnaird, to you, and to Hanson, because the silence of so long a
time made me tear off my remaining rags of patience. I have seen
one<span class="pagenum"><a id="page128" name="page128"></a>Pg 128</span> or two late English publications which are no great things,

finished, but will be too long; and there are so many things,
which, out of regard to the living, cannot be mentioned, that I
have written with too much detail of that which interested me
least; so that my autobiographical Essay would resemble the tragedy
of Hamlet at the country theatre, recited 'with the part of Hamlet

will be a kind of guide-post in case of death, and prevent some of

large, long paper, and will be about fifty or sixty; but I wish to
go on leisurely; and when finished, although it might do a good

<p>To the charge brought against Lord Byron by some English travellers of
being, in general, repulsive and inhospitable to his own countrymen, I
have already made allusion; and shall now add to the testimony then
cited in disproof of such a charge some particulars, communicated to me
by Captain Basil Hall, which exhibit the courtesy and kindliness of the
noble poet's disposition in their true, natural light.</p>

<p>"On the last day of August, 1818 (says this distinguished writer and
traveller), I was taken ill with an ague at Venice, and having heard
enough of the low state of the medical art in that country, I was not a
little anxious as to the advice I should take. I was not acquainted with
any person in Venice to whom I could refer, and had only one letter of
in<span class="pagenum"><a id="page130" name="page130"></a>Pg 130</span>troduction, which was to Lord Byron; but as there were many stories
floating about of his Lordship's unwillingness to be pestered with
tourists, I had felt unwilling, before this moment, to intrude myself in
that shape. Now, however, that I was seriously unwell, I felt sure that
this offensive character would merge in that of a countryman in
distress, and I sent the letter by one of my travelling companions to
Lord Byron's lodgings, with a note, excusing the liberty I was taking,
explaining that I was in want of medical assistance, and saying I should
not send to any one till I heard the name of the person who, in his
Lordship's opinion, was the best practitioner in Venice.</p>

<p>"Unfortunately for me, Lord Byron was still in bed, though it was near
noon, and still more unfortunately, the bearer of my message scrupled to
awake him, without first coming back to consult me. By this time I was
in all the agonies of a cold ague fit, and, therefore, not at all in a
condition to be consulted upon any thing&mdash;so I replied pettishly, 'Oh,
by no means disturb Lord Byron on my account&mdash;ring for the landlord, and
send for any one he recommends.' This absurd injunction being forthwith
and literally attended to, in the course of an hour I was under the
discipline of mine host's friend, whose skill and success it is no part
of my present purpose to descant upon:&mdash;it is sufficient to mention that
I was irrevocably in his hands long before the following most kind note
was brought to me, in great haste, by Lord Byron's servant.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"'Venice, August 31. 1818.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page131" name="page131"></a>Pg 131</span></p>

<p>"'Dear Sir,</p>

<p>"'Dr. Aglietti is the best physician, not only in Venice, but in
Italy: his residence is on the Grand Canal, and easily found; I
forget the number, but am probably the only person in Venice who
don't know it. There is no comparison between him and any of the
other medical people here. I regret very much to hear of your
indisposition, and shall do myself the honour of waiting upon you
the moment I am up. I write this in bed, and have only just
received the letter and note. I beg you to believe that nothing but
the extreme lateness of my hours could have prevented me from
replying immediately, or coming in person. I have not been called a
minute.&mdash;I have the honour to be, very truly,</p>

<p>"'Your most obedient servant,</p>

<p>"'BYRON.'</p></div>

<p>"His Lordship soon followed this note, and I heard his voice in the next
room; but although he waited more than an hour, I could not see him,
being under the inexorable hands of the doctor. In the course of the
same evening he again called, but I was asleep. When I awoke I found his
Lordship's valet sitting by my bedside. 'He had his master's orders,' he
said, 'to remain with me while I was unwell, and was instructed to say,
that whatever his Lordship had, or could procure, was at my service, and
that he would come to me and sit with me, or do whatever I liked, if I
would only let him know in what way he could be useful.'</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page132" name="page132"></a>Pg 132</span></p>

<p>"Accordingly, on the next day, I sent for some book, which was brought,
with a list of his library. I forget what it was which prevented my
seeing Lord Byron on this day, though he called more than once; and on
the next, I was too ill with fever to talk to any one.</p>

<p>"The moment I could get out, I took a gondola and went to pay my
respects, and to thank his Lordship for his attentions. It was then
nearly three o'clock, but he was not yet up; and when I went again on
the following day at five, I had the mortification to learn that he had
gone, at the same hour, to call upon me, so that we had crossed each
other on the canal; and, to my deep and lasting regret, I was obliged to
leave Venice without seeing him."</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Venice, September 19. 1818.</p>

<p>"An English newspaper here would be a prodigy, and an opposition
one a monster; and except some ex tracts <i>from</i> extracts in the
vile, garbled Paris gazettes, nothing of the kind reaches the
Veneto-Lombard public, who are, perhaps, the most oppressed in
Europe. My correspondences with England are mostly on business, and
chiefly with my * * *, who has no very exalted notion, or extensive
conception, of an author's attributes; for he once took up an
Edinburgh Review, and, looking at it a minute, said to me, 'So, I
see you have got into the magazine,'&mdash;which is the only sentence I
ever heard him utter upon literary matters, or the men thereof.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page133" name="page133"></a>Pg 133</span></p>

<p>"My first news of your Irish Apotheosis has, consequently, been
from yourself. But, as it will not be forgotten in a hurry, either
by your friends or your enemies, I hope to have it more in detail
from some of the former, and, in the mean time, I wish you joy with
all my heart. Such a moment must have been a good deal better than
Westminster-abbey,&mdash;besides being an assurance of <i>that</i> one day
(many years hence, I trust,) into the bargain.</p>

<p>"I am sorry to perceive, however, by the close of your letter, that
even <i>you</i> have not escaped the 'surgit amari,' &amp;c. and that your
damned deputy has been gathering such 'dew from the still <i>vext</i>
Bermoothes'&mdash;or rather <i>vexatious</i>. Pray, give me some items of the
affair, as you say it is a serious one; and, if it grows more so,
you should make a trip over here for a few months, to see how
things turn out. I suppose you are a violent admirer of England by
your staying so long in it. For my own part, I have passed, between
the age of one-and-twenty and thirty, half the intervenient years
out of it without regretting any thing, except that I ever returned
to it at all, and the gloomy prospect before me of business and
parentage obliging me, one day, to return to it again,&mdash;at least,
for the transaction of affairs, the signing of papers, and
inspecting of children.</p>

<p>"I have here my natural daughter, by name Allegra,&mdash;a pretty little
girl enough, and reckoned like papa.<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> Her mamma is English,&mdash;but
it is a<span class="pagenum"><a id="page134" name="page134"></a>Pg 134</span> long story, and&mdash;there's an end. She is about twenty
months old.</p>

<p>"I have finished the first Canto (a long one, of about 180 octaves)
of a poem in the style and manner of 'Beppo', encouraged by the
good success of the same. It is called 'Don Juan', and is meant to
be a little quietly facetious upon every thing. But I doubt whether
it is not&mdash;at least, as far as it has yet gone&mdash;too free for these
very modest days. However, I shall try the experiment, anonymously,
and if it don't take, it will be discontinued. It is dedicated to S
* * in good, simple, savage verse, upon the * * * *'s politics, and
the way he got them. But the bore of copying it out is intolerable;
and if<span class="pagenum"><a id="page135" name="page135"></a>Pg 135</span> I had an amanuensis he would be of no use, as my writing is

<span class="i4">New characters, &amp;c. &amp;c.<br /></span>

<p>The above are two stanzas, which I send you as a brick of my Babel,
and by which you can judge of the texture of the structure.</p>

<p>"In writing the Life of Sheridan, never mind the angry lies of the
humbug Whigs. Recollect that he was an Irishman and a clever
fellow, and that we have had some very pleasant days with him.
Don't forget that he was at school at Harrow, where, in my time, we
used to show his name&mdash;R.B. Sheridan, 1765,&mdash;as an honour to the
walls. Remember * *. Depend upon it that there were worse folks
going, of that gang, than ever Sheridan was.</p>

<p>"What did Parr mean by 'haughtiness and coldness?' I listened to
him with admiring ignorance, and respectful silence. What more
could a talker for fame have?&mdash;they don't like to be answered. It
was at Payne Knight's I met him, where he gave me more Greek than I
could carry away. But I certainly meant to (and <i>did</i>) treat him
with the most respectful deference.</p>

<p>"I wish you a good night, with a Venetian benediction, 'Benedetto
te, e la terra che ti fara!'&mdash;'May you be blessed, and the <i>earth</i>
which you will<span class="pagenum"><a id="page136" name="page136"></a>Pg 136</span> <i>make</i>!'&mdash;is it not pretty? You would think it
still prettier if you had heard it, as I did two hours ago, from
the lips of a Venetian girl, with large black eyes, a face like
Faustina's, and the figure of a Juno&mdash;tall and energetic as a
Pythoness, with eyes flashing, and her dark hair streaming in the
moonlight&mdash;one of those women who may be made any thing. I am sure
if I put a poniard into the hand of this one, she would plunge it
where I told her,&mdash;and into <i>me</i>, if I offended her. I like this
kind of animal, and am sure that I should have preferred Medea to
any woman that ever breathed. You may, perhaps, wonder that I don't
in that case. I could have forgiven the dagger or the bowl, any
thing, but the deliberate desolation piled upon me, when I stood
alone upon my hearth, with my household gods shivered around me<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a>
* * Do you suppose I have forgotten or forgiven it? It has
comparatively swallowed up in me every other feeling, and I am only
a spectator upon earth, till a tenfold opportunity offers. It may
come yet. There are others more to be blamed than * * * *, and it
is on these that my eyes are fixed unceasingly."</p></div>

fashions, which become you as paint became the ancient Britons. If
you admit this prudery, you must omit half Ariosto, La Fontaine,
Shakspeare, Beaumont, Fletcher, Massinger, Ford, all the Charles

puritanical committee have protested against publishing. But we
will circumvent them on that point. I have not yet begun to copy
out the second Canto, which is finished, from natural laziness, and
the discouragement of the milk and water they have thrown upon the

the poetry was bad, I would have acquiesced; but they say the
contrary, and then talk to me about morality&mdash;the first time I ever
heard the word from any body who was not a rascal that used it for

which happens to be the most indigestible of marine viands.
However, within these last two days, I am better, and very truly

<p><b>LETTER 327. TO MR. MURRAY.</b></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Venice, April 6. 1819.</p>

<p>"The second Canto of Don Juan was sent, on Saturday last, by post,
in four packets, two of four, and two of three sheets each,
containing in all two hundred and seventeen stanzas, octave
measure. But I will permit no curtailments, except those mentioned
about Castlereagh and * * * *. You sha'n't make <i>canticles</i> of my
cantos. The poem will please, if it is lively; if it is stupid, it
will fail: but I will have none of your damned cutting and
slashing. If you please, you may publish <i>anonymously</i>; it will
perhaps be better; but I will battle my way against them all, like
a porcupine.</p>

<p>"So you and Mr. Foscolo, &amp;c. want me to undertake what you call a
'great work?' an Epic Poem, I suppose, or some such pyramid. I'll
try no such thing; I hate tasks. And then 'seven or eight years!'
God send us all well this day three months, let alone years. If
one's years can't be better employed than in sweating poesy, a man
had better be a ditcher. And works, too!&mdash;is Childe Harold<span class="pagenum"><a id="page142" name="page142"></a>Pg 142</span>
nothing? You have so many 'divine poems,' is it nothing to have
written a <i>human</i> one? without any of your worn-out machinery. Why,
man, I could have spun the thoughts of the four Cantos of that poem
into twenty, had I wanted to book-make, and its passion into as
many modern tragedies. Since you want <i>length</i>, you shall have
enough of <i>Juan</i>, for I'll make fifty Cantos.</p>

<p>"And Foscolo, too! Why does <i>he</i> not do something more than the
Letters of Ortis, and a tragedy, and pamphlets? He has good fifteen
years more at his command than I have: what has he done all that
time?&mdash;proved his genius, doubtless, but not fixed its fame, nor
done his utmost.</p>

<p>"Besides, I mean to write my best work in <i>Italian</i>, and it will
take me nine years more thoroughly to master the language; and then
if my fancy exist, and I exist too, I will try what I <i>can</i> do
<i>really</i>. As to the estimation of the English which you talk of,
let them calculate what it is worth, before they insult me with
their insolent condescension.</p>

<p>"I have not written for their pleasure. If they are pleased, it is
that they chose to be so; I have never flattered their opinions,
nor their pride; nor will I. Neither will I make 'Ladies' books 'al
dilettar le femine e la plebe.' I have written from the fulness of
my mind, from passion, from impulse, from many motives, but not for
their 'sweet voices.'</p>

<p>"I know the precise worth of popular applause, for few scribblers
have had more of it; and if I chose to swerve into their paths, I
could retain it,<span class="pagenum"><a id="page143" name="page143"></a>Pg 143</span> or resume it. But I neither love ye, nor fear ye;
and though I buy with ye and sell with ye, I will neither eat with
ye, drink with ye, nor pray with ye. They made me, without any
search, a species of popular idol; they, without reason or
judgment, beyond the caprice of their good pleasure, threw down the
image from its pedestal; it was not broken with the fall, and they
would, it seems, again replace it,&mdash;but they shall not.</p>

<p>"You ask about my health: about the beginning of the year I was in
a state of great exhaustion, attended by such debility of stomach
that nothing remained upon it; and I was obliged to reform my 'way
of life,' which was conducting me from the 'yellow leaf' to the
ground, with all deliberate speed. I am better in health and
morals, and very much yours, &amp;c.</p>

<p>"P.S. I have read Hodgson's 'Friends.' He is right in defending
Pope against the bastard pelicans of the poetical winter day, who
add insult to their parricide, by sucking the blood of the parent
of English <i>real</i> poetry,&mdash;poetry without fault,&mdash;and then spurning
the bosom which fed them."</p></div>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>It was about the time when the foregoing letter was written, and when,
as we perceive, like the first return of reason after intoxication, a
full consciousness of some of the evils of his late libertine course of
life had broken upon him, that an attachment differing altogether, both
in duration and devotion, from any of those that, since the dream of his
boyhood, had inspired him, gained an influence<span class="pagenum"><a id="page144" name="page144"></a>Pg 144</span> over his mind which
lasted through his few remaining years; and, undeniably wrong and
immoral (even allowing for the Italian estimate of such frailties) as
was the nature of the connection to which this attachment led, we can
hardly perhaps,&mdash;taking into account the far worse wrong from which it
rescued and preserved him,&mdash;consider it otherwise than as an event
fortunate both for his reputation and happiness.</p>

<p>The fair object of this last, and (with one signal exception) only
<i>real</i> love of his whole life, was a young Romagnese lady, the daughter
of Count Gamba, of Ravenna, and married, but a short time before Lord
Byron first met with her, to an old and wealthy widower, of the same
city, Count Guiccioli. Her husband had in early life been the friend of
Alfieri, and had distinguished himself by his zeal in promoting the
establishment of a National Theatre, in which the talents of Alfieri and
his own wealth were to be combined. Notwithstanding his age, and a
character, as it appears, by no means reputable, his great opulence
rendered him an object of ambition among the mothers of Ravenna, who,
according to the too frequent maternal practice, were seen vying with
each other in attracting so rich a purchaser for their daughters, and
the young Teresa Gamba, not yet sixteen, and just emancipated from a
convent, was the selected victim.</p>

<p>The first time Lord Byron had ever seen this lady was in the autumn of
1818, when she made her appearance, three days after her marriage, at
the house of the Countess Albrizzi, in all the gaiety of bridal array,<span class="pagenum"><a id="page145" name="page145"></a>Pg 145</span>
and the first delight of exchanging a convent for the world. At this
time, however, no acquaintance ensued between them;&mdash;it was not till the
spring of the present year that, at an evening party of Madame
Benzoni's, they were introduced to each other. The love that sprung out
of this meeting was instantaneous and mutual, though with the usual
disproportion of sacrifice between the parties; such an event being, to
the man, but one of the many scenes of life, while, with woman, it
generally constitutes the whole drama. The young Italian found herself
suddenly inspired with a passion of which, till that moment, her mind
could not have formed the least idea;&mdash;she had thought of love but as an
amusement, and now became its slave. If at the outset, too, less slow to
be won than an Englishwoman, no sooner did she begin to understand the
full despotism of the passion than her heart shrunk from it as something
terrible, and she would have escaped, but that the chain was already
around her.</p>

<p>No words, however, can describe so simply and feelingly as her own, the
strong impression which their first meeting left upon her mind:&mdash;</p>

<p>"I became acquainted (says Madame Guiccioli) with Lord Byron in the
April of 1819:&mdash;he was introduced to me at Venice, by the Countess
Benzoni, at one of that lady's parties. This introduction, which had so
much influence over the lives of us both, took place contrary to our
wishes, and had been permitted by us only from courtesy. For myself,
more fatigued than usual that evening on<span class="pagenum"><a id="page146" name="page146"></a>Pg 146</span> account of the late hours they
keep at Venice, I went with great repugnance to this party, and purely
in obedience to Count Guiccioli. Lord Byron, too, who was averse to
forming new acquaintances,&mdash;alleging that he had entirely renounced all
attachments, and was unwilling any more to expose himself to their
consequences,&mdash;on being requested by the countess Benzoni to allow
himself to be presented to me, refused, and, at last, only assented from
a desire to oblige her.</p>

<p>"His noble and exquisitely beautiful countenance, the tone of his voice,
his manners, the thousand enchantments that surrounded him, rendered him
so different and so superior a being to any whom I had hitherto seen,
that it was impossible he should not have left the most profound
impression upon me. From that evening, during the whole of my subsequent
stay at Venice, we met every day."<a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a></p>

<p>"I have got your extract, and the 'Vampire.' I need not say it is
<i>not mine</i>. There is a rule to go by: you are my publisher (till we
quarrel), and what is not published by you is not written by me.</p>

<p>"Next week I set out for Romagna&mdash;at least, in all probability. You
had better go on with the publications, without waiting to hear
farther, for I have other things in my head. 'Mazeppa' and the

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>In another letter on the subject of the Vampire, I find the following
interesting particulars:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"<b>TO MR. &mdash;&mdash;.</b></p>

<p>"The story of Shelley's agitation is true.<a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> I can't tell what
seized him, for he don't want courage.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page148" name="page148"></a>Pg 148</span> He was once with me in a
gale of wind, in a small boat, right under the rocks between
Meillerie and St. Gingo. We were five in the boat&mdash;a servant, two
boatmen, and ourselves. The sail was mismanaged, and the boat was
filling fast. He can't swim. I stripped off my coat, made him strip
off his, and take hold of an oar, telling him that I thought (being
myself an expert swimmer) I could save him, if he would not
struggle when I took hold of him&mdash;unless we got smashed against the
rocks, which were high and sharp, with an awkward surf on them at
that minute. We were then about a hundred yards from shore, and the
boat in peril. He answered me with the greatest coolness, 'that he
had no notion of being saved, and that I would have enough to do to
save myself, and begged not to trouble me.' Luckily, the boat
righted, and, bailing, we got round a point into St. Gingo, where
the inhabitants came down and embraced the boatmen on their escape,
the wind having been high enough to tear up some huge trees from
the Alps above us, as we saw next day.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page149" name="page149"></a>Pg 149</span></p>

<p>"And yet the same Shelley, who was as cool as it was possible to be
in such circumstances, (of which I am no judge myself, as the
chance of swimming naturally gives self-possession when near
shore,) certainly had the fit of phantasy which Polidori describes,
though <i>not exactly</i> as he describes it.</p>

<p>"The story of the agreement to write the ghost-books is true; but
the ladies are <i>not</i> sisters. Mary Godwin (now Mrs. Shelley) wrote
Frankenstein, which you have reviewed, thinking it Shelley's.
Methinks it is a wonderful book for a girl of nineteen,&mdash;not
nineteen, indeed, at that time. I enclose you the beginning of
mine, by which you will see how far it resembles Mr. Colburn's
publication. If you choose to publish it, you may, <i>stating why</i>,
and with such explanatory proem as you please. I never went on with
it, as you will perceive by the date. I began it in an old
account-book of Miss Milbanke's, which I kept because it contains
the word 'Household,' written by her twice on the inside blank page
of the covers, being the only two scraps I have in the world in her
writing, except her name to the Deed of Separation. Her letters I
sent back except those of the quarrelling correspondence, and
those, being documents, are placed in the hands of a third person,
with copies of several of my own; so that I have no kind of
memorial whatever of her, but these two words,&mdash;and her actions. I
have torn the leaves containing the part of the Tale out of the
book, and enclose them with this sheet.</p>

<p>"What do you mean? First you seem hurt by my letter, and then, in
your next, you talk of its<span class="pagenum"><a id="page150" name="page150"></a>Pg 150</span> 'power,' and so forth. 'This is a
d&mdash;&mdash;d blind story, Jack; but never mind, go on.' You may be sure I
said nothing <i>on purpose</i> to plague you; but if you will put me 'in
a frenzy, I will never call you <i>Jack</i> again.' I remember nothing
of the epistle at present.</p>

<p>"What do you mean by Polidori's <i>Diary</i>? Why, I defy him to say any
thing about me, but he is welcome. I have nothing to reproach me
with on his score, and I am much mistaken if that is not his <i>own</i>
opinion. But why publish the names of the two girls? and in such a
manner?&mdash;what a blundering piece of exculpation! <i>He</i> asked Pictet,
&amp;c. to dinner, and of course was left to entertain them. I went
into society <i>solely</i> to present <i>him</i> (as I told him), that he
might return into good company if he chose; it was the best thing
for his youth and circumstances: for myself, I had done with
society, and, having presented him, withdrew to my own 'way of
life.' It is true that I returned without entering Lady Dalrymple
Hamilton's, because I saw it full. It is true that Mrs. Hervey (she
writes novels) fainted at my entrance into Coppet, and then came
back again. On her fainting, the Duchess de Broglie exclaimed,
'This is <i>too much</i>&mdash;at <i>sixty-five</i> years of age!'&mdash;I never gave
'the English' an opportunity of avoiding me; but I trust that, if
ever I do, they will seize it. With regard to Mazeppa and the Ode,
you may join or separate them, as you please, from the two Cantos.</p>

<p>"Don't suppose I want to put you out of humour. I have a great
respect for your good and gentlemanly<span class="pagenum"><a id="page151" name="page151"></a>Pg 151</span> qualities, and return your
personal friendship towards me; and although I think you a little
spoilt by 'villanous company,'&mdash;wits, persons of honour about town,
authors, and fashionables, together with your 'I am just going to
call at Carlton House, are you walking that way?'&mdash;I say,
notwithstanding 'pictures, taste, Shakspeare, and the musical
glasses,' you deserve and possess the esteem of those whose esteem
is worth having, and of none more (however useless it may be) than
yours very truly, &amp;c.</p>

<p>"P.S. Make my respects to Mr. Gifford. I am perfectly aware that
'Don Juan' must set us all by the ears, but that is my concern, and
my beginning. There will be the 'Edinburgh,' and all, too, against
it, so that, like 'Rob Roy,' I shall have my hands full."</p></div>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>About the middle of April, Madame Guiccioli had been obliged to quit
Venice with her husband. Having several houses on the road from Venice
to Ravenna, it was his habit to stop at these mansions, one after the
other, in his journeys between the two cities; and from all these places
the enamoured young Countess now wrote to Lord Byron, expressing, in the
most passionate and pathetic terms, her despair at leaving him. So
utterly, indeed, did this feeling overpower her, that three times, in
the course of her first day's journey, she was seized with fainting
fits. In one of her letters, which I saw when at Venice, dated, if I
recollect right, from "C&agrave; Zen, Cavanelle di Po," she tells him that the
solitude of this place, which she had before found irksome, was, now
that one sole idea occupied her mind, become dear and welcome to her,
and promises that, as soon as she arrives at Ravenna, "she will,
according to his wish, avoid all general society, and devote herself to
reading, music, domestic occupations, riding on horseback,&mdash;every thing,
in short, that she knew he would most like." What a change for a young
and simple girl, who, but a few weeks before, had thought only of
society and the world, but who now saw no other happiness but in the
hope of making herself worthy, by seclusion and self-instruction, of the
illustrious object of her devotion!</p>

<p>On leaving this place, she was attacked with a<span class="pagenum"><a id="page154" name="page154"></a>Pg 154</span> dangerous illness on the
road, and arrived half dead at Ravenna; nor was it found possible to
revive or comfort her till an assurance was received from Lord Byron,
expressed with all the fervour of real passion, that, in the course of
the ensuing month, he would pay her a visit. Symptoms of consumption,
brought on by her state of mind, had already shown themselves; and, in
addition to the pain which this separation had caused her, she was also
suffering much grief from the loss of her mother, who, at this time,
died in giving birth to her fourteenth child. Towards the latter end of
May she wrote to acquaint Lord Byron that, having prepared all her
relatives and friends to expect him, he might now, she thought, venture
to make his appearance at Ravenna. Though, on the lady's account,
hesitating as to the prudence of such a step, he, in obedience to her
wishes, on the 2d of June, set out from La Mira (at which place he had
again taken a villa for the summer), and proceeded towards Romagna.</p>

<p>From Padua he addressed a letter to Mr. Hoppner, chiefly occupied with
matters of household concern which that gentleman had undertaken to
manage for him at Venice, but, on the immediate object of his journey,
expressing himself in a tone so light and jesting, as it would be
difficult for those not versed in his character to conceive that he
could ever bring himself, while under the influence of a passion so
sincere, to assume. But such is ever the wantonness of the mocking
spirit, from which nothing,&mdash;not even love,&mdash;remains sacred; and which,
at last, for want of other food, turns upon himself. The<span class="pagenum"><a id="page155" name="page155"></a>Pg 155</span> same horror,
too, of hypocrisy that led Lord Byron to exaggerate his own errors, led
him also to disguise, under a seemingly heartless ridicule, all those
natural and kindly qualities by which they were redeemed.</p>

<p>This letter from Padua concludes thus:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"A journey in an Italian June is a conscription; and if I was not
the most constant of men, I should now be swimming from the Lido,
instead of smoking in the dust of Padua. Should there be letters

(not lands, but) waters, and scold;&mdash;and deal out the monies to

<p><b>LETTER 330. TO MR. HOPPNER.</b></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Bologna, June 6. 1819.</p>

<p>"I am at length joined to Bologna, where I am settled like a
sausage, and shall be broiled like one, if this weather continues.
Will you thank Mengaldo on my part for the Ferrara acquaintance,
which was a very agreeable one. I stayed two days at Ferrara, and
was much pleased with the Count Mosti, and the little the shortness
of the time permitted me to see of his family. I went to his
conversazione, which is very far superior to any thing of the kind
at Venice&mdash;the women almost all young&mdash;several pretty&mdash;and the men
courteous and cleanly. The lady of the mansion, who is young,
lately married, and with child, appeared very pretty by candlelight
(I did not see her by day), pleasing in her manners, and very
lady-like, or thorough-bred, as we call it in England,&mdash;a kind of
thing which reminds one of a racer, an antelope, or an Italian
greyhound. She seems very fond of her husband, who is amiable and
accomplished; he has been in England two or three times, and is
young. The sister, a Countess somebody&mdash;I forget what&mdash;(they are
both Maffei by birth, and Veronese of course)&mdash;is a lady of more
display; she sings and plays divinely; but I thought she was a
d&mdash;&mdash;d long time about it. Her likeness to Madame Flahaut (Miss
Mercer that was) is something quite extraordinary.</p>

<p>"I had but a bird's eye view of these people, and shall not
probably see them again; but I am very much obliged to Mengaldo for
letting me see them<span class="pagenum"><a id="page159" name="page159"></a>Pg 159</span> at all. Whenever I meet with any thing
agreeable in this world, it surprises me so much, and pleases me so
much (when my passions are not interested one way or the other),
that I go on wondering for a week to come. I feel, too, in great
admiration of the Cardinal Legate's red stockings.</p>

<p>"I found, too, such a pretty epitaph in the Certosa cemetery, or
rather two: one was</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i4">'Martini Luigi<br /></span>
<span class="i6">Implora pace;'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>the other,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i4">'Lucrezia Picini<br /></span>
<span class="i6">Implora eterna quiete.'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>That was all; but it appears to me that these two and three words
comprise and compress all that can be said on the subject,&mdash;and
then, in Italian, they are absolute music. They contain doubt,
hope, and humility; nothing can be more pathetic than the 'implora'
and the modesty of the request;&mdash;they have had enough of life&mdash;they
want nothing but rest&mdash;they implore it, and 'eterna quiete.' It is
like a Greek inscription in some good old heathen 'City of the
Dead.' Pray, if I am shovelled into the Lido churchyard in your
time, let me have the 'implora pace,' and nothing else, for my
epitaph. I never met with any, ancient or modern, that pleased me a
tenth part so much.</p>

<p>"In about a day or two after you receive this letter, I will thank
you to desire Edgecombe to prepare for my return. I shall go back
to Venice before I village on the Brenta. I shall stay but a<span class="pagenum"><a id="page160" name="page160"></a>Pg 160</span> few
days in Bologna. I am just going out to see sights, but shall not
present my introductory letters for a day or two, till I have run
over again the place and pictures; nor perhaps at all, if I find
that I have books and sights enough to do without the inhabitants.
After that, I shall return to Venice, where you may expect me about
the eleventh, or perhaps sooner. Pray make my thanks acceptable to
Mengaldo: my respects to the Consuless, and to Mr. Scott. I hope my
daughter is well.</p>

<p>"Ever yours, and truly.</p>

<p>"P.S. I went over the Ariosto MS. &amp;c. &amp;c. again at Ferrara, with
the castle, and cell, and house, &amp;c. &amp;c.</p>

<p>"One of the Ferrarese asked me if I knew 'Lord Byron,' an
acquaintance of his, <i>now</i> at Naples. I told him '<i>No!</i>' which was
true both ways; for I knew not the impostor, and in the other, no
one knows himself. He stared when told that I was 'the real Simon
Pure.' Another asked me if I had <i>not translated</i> 'Tasso.' You see
what <i>fame</i> is! how <i>accurate!</i> how <i>boundless!</i> I don't know how
others feel, but I am always the lighter and the better looked on
when I have got rid of mine; it sits on me like armour on the Lord
Mayor's champion; and I got rid of all the husk of literature, and
the attendant babble, by answering, that I had not translated
Tasso, but a namesake had; and by the blessing of Heaven, I looked
so little like a poet, that every body believed me."</p></div><p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page161" name="page161"></a>Pg 161</span></p>

<p><b>LETTER 331. TO MR. MURRAY.</b></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Bologna, June 7. 1819.</p>

<p>"Tell Mr. Hobhouse that I wrote to him a few days ago from Ferrara.
It will therefore be idle in him or you to wait for any further
answers or returns of proofs from Venice, as I have directed that
no English letters be sent after me. The publication can be
proceeded in without, and I am already sick of your remarks, to
which I think not the least attention ought to be paid.</p>

<p>"Tell Mr. Hobhouse that, since I wrote to him, I had availed myself
of my Ferrara letters, and found the society much younger and
better there than at Venice. I am very much pleased with the little
the shortness of my stay permitted me to see of the Gonfaloniere
Count Mosti, and his family and friends in general.</p>

<p>"I have been picture-gazing this morning at the famous Domenichino
and Guido, both of which are superlative. I afterwards went to the
beautiful cemetery of Bologna, beyond the walls, and found, besides
the superb burial-ground, an original of a Custode, who reminded
one of the grave-digger in Hamlet. He has a collection of
capuchins' skulls, labelled on the forehead, and taking down one of
them, said, 'This was Brother Desiderio Berro, who died at
forty&mdash;one of my best friends. I begged his head of his brethren
after his decease, and they gave it me. I put it in lime, and then
boiled it. Here it is, teeth and all, in excellent preservation. He
was the merriest, cleverest fellow I ever knew. Wherever<span class="pagenum"><a id="page162" name="page162"></a>Pg 162</span> he went,
he brought joy; and whenever any one was melancholy, the sight of
him was enough to make him cheerful again. He walked so actively,
you might have taken him for a dancer&mdash;he joked&mdash;he laughed&mdash;oh! he
was such a Frate as I never saw before, nor ever shall again!'</p>

<p>"He told me that he had himself planted all the cypresses in the
cemetery; that he had the greatest attachment to them and to his
dead people; that since 1801 they had buried fifty-three thousand
persons. In showing some older monuments, there was that of a Roman
girl of twenty, with a bust by Bernini. She was a princess
Bartorini, dead two centuries ago: he said that, on opening her
grave, they had found her hair complete, and 'as yellow as gold.'
Some of the epitaphs at Ferrara pleased me more than the more
splendid monuments at Bologna; for instance:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i4">"Martini Luigi<br /></span>
<span class="i6">Implora pace;<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i4">"Lucrezia Picini<br /></span>
<span class="i6">Implora eterna quiete.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Can any thing be more full of pathos? Those few words say all that
can be said or sought: the dead had had enough of life; all they
wanted was rest, and this they <i>implore</i>! There is all the
helplessness, and humble hope, and deathlike prayer, that can arise
from the grave&mdash;'implora pace.'<a name="FNanchor_34_34" id="FNanchor_34_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a> I hope,<span class="pagenum"><a id="page163" name="page163"></a>Pg 163</span> whoever may survive
me, and shall see me put in the foreigners' burying-ground at the
Lido, within the fortress by the Adriatic, will see those two
words, and no more, put over me. I trust they won't think of
'pickling, and bringing me home to Clod or Blunderbuss Hall.' I am
sure my bones would not rest in an English grave, or my clay mix
with the earth of that country. I believe the thought would drive
me mad on my deathbed, could I suppose that any of my friends would
be base enough to convey my carcass back to your soil. I would not
even feed your worms, if I could help it.</p>

<p>"So, as Shakspeare says of Mowbray, the banished Duke of Norfolk,
who died at Venice (see Richard II.) that he, after fighting</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i4">"'Against black Pagans, Turks, and Saracens,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">And toiled with works of war, retired himself<br /></span>
<span class="i4">To Italy, and there, at <i>Venice</i>, gave<br /></span>
<span class="i4">His body to that <i>pleasant</i> country's earth,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">And his pure soul unto his captain, Christ,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Under whose colours he had fought so long.'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>"Before I left Venice, I had returned to you your late, and Mr.
Hobhouse's sheets of Juan. Don't wait for further answers from me,
but address yours to<span class="pagenum"><a id="page164" name="page164"></a>Pg 164</span> Venice, as usual. I know nothing of my own
movements; I may return there in a few days, or not for some time.
All this depends on circumstances. I left Mr. Hoppner very well. My
daughter Allegra was well too, and is growing pretty; her hair is
growing darker, and her eyes are blue. Her temper and her ways, Mr.
Hoppner says, are like mine, as well as her features: she will
make, in that case, a manageable young lady.</p>

<p>"I have never heard any thing of Ada, the little Electra of
Mycenae. But there will come a day of reckoning, even if I should
not live to see it.<a name="FNanchor_35_35" id="FNanchor_35_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a> What a long letter I have scribbled! Yours,
&amp;c.</p>

<p>"P.S. Here, as in Greece, they strew flowers on the tombs. I saw a
quantity of rose-leaves, and entire roses, scattered over the
graves at Ferrara. It has the most pleasing effect you can
imagine."</p></div>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>While he was thus lingering irresolute at Bo<span class="pagenum"><a id="page165" name="page165"></a>Pg 165</span>logna, the Countess
Guiccioli had been attacked with an intermittent fever, the violence of
which, combining with the absence of a confidential person to whom she
had been in the habit of intrusting her letters, prevented her from
communicating with him. At length, anxious to spare him the
disappointment of finding her so ill on his arrival, she had begun a
letter, requesting that he would remain at Bologna till the visit to
which she looked forward should bring her there also; and was in the act
of writing, when a friend came in to announce the arrival of an English
lord in Ravenna. She could not doubt for an instant that it was her
noble friend; and he had, in fact, notwithstanding his declaration to
Mr. Hoppner that it was his intention to return to Venice immediately,
wholly altered this resolution before the letter announcing it was
despatched,&mdash;the following words being written on the outside cover:&mdash;"I
am just setting off for Ravenna, June 8. 1819.&mdash;I changed my mind this
morning, and decided to go on."</p>

<p>The reader, however, shall have Madame Guiccioli's own account of these
events, which, fortunately for the interest of my narration, I am
enabled to communicate.</p>

<p>"On my departure from Venice, he had promised to come and see me at
Ravenna. Dante's tomb, the classical pine wood<a name="FNanchor_36_36" id="FNanchor_36_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a>, the relics of
antiquity which<span class="pagenum"><a id="page166" name="page166"></a>Pg 166</span> are to be found in that place, afforded a sufficient
pretext for me to invite him to come, and for him to accept my
invitation. He came, in fact, in the month of June, arriving at Ravenna
on the day of the festival of the Corpus Domini; while I, attacked by a
consumptive complaint, which had its origin from the moment of my
quitting Venice, appeared on the point of death. The arrival of a
distinguished foreigner at Ravenna, a town so remote from the routes
ordinarily followed by travellers, was an event which gave rise to a
good deal of conversation. His motives for such a visit became the
subject of discussion, and these he himself afterwards involuntarily
divulged; for having made some enquiries with a view to paying me a
visit, and being told that it was unlikely that he would ever see me
again, as I was at the point of death, he replied, if such were the
case, he hoped that he should die also; which circumstance, being
repeated, revealed the object of his journey. Count Guiccioli, having
been acquainted with Lord Byron at Venice, went to visit him now, and in
the hope that his presence might amuse, and be of some use to me in the
state in which I then found myself, invited him to call upon me. He came
the day following. It is impossible to describe the anxiety he
showed,&mdash;the delicate attentions that he paid me. For a long time he had
perpetually medical books in his hands; and<span class="pagenum"><a id="page167" name="page167"></a>Pg 167</span> not trusting my physicians,
he obtained permission from Count Guiccioli to send for a very clever
physician, a friend of his, in whom he placed great confidence. The
attentions of Professor Aglietti (for so this celebrated Italian was
called), together with tranquillity, and the inexpressible happiness
which I experienced in Lord Byron's society, had so good an effect on my
health, that only two months afterwards I was able to accompany my
husband in a tour he was obliged to make to visit his various
estates."<a name="FNanchor_37_37" id="FNanchor_37_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a></p>

<p>"I wrote to you from Padua, and from Bologna, and since from
Ravenna. I find my situation very agreeable, but want my horses
very much, there being good riding in the environs. I can fix no
time for my return to Venice&mdash;it may be soon or late&mdash;or not at

porcupines who may point their quills at you.</p>

<p>"I have been here (at Ravenna) these four weeks, having left Venice
a month ago;&mdash;I came to see my 'Amica,' the Countess Guiccioli, who
has been, and still continues, very unwell. * * She is only in her
seventeenth, but not of a strong constitution. She has a perpetual
cough and an intermittent fever, but bears up most <i>gallantly</i> in
every sense of the word. Her husband (this is his third wife) is
the richest noble of Ravenna, and almost of Romagna; he is also
<i>not</i> the youngest, being upwards of three-score, but in good
preservation. All this will appear strange to you, who do not
understand the meridian morality, nor our way of life in such
respects, and I cannot at present expound the difference;&mdash;but you
would find it much the same in these parts. At Faenza there is Lord
* * * * with an opera girl; and at the inn in the same town is a
Neapolitan Prince, who serves the wife of the Gonfaloniere of that
city. I am on duty here&mdash;so you see 'Cos&igrave; fan tut<i>ti</i> e tut<i>te</i>.'</p>

<p>"I have my horses here, <i>saddle</i> as well as carriage, and ride or
drive every day in the forest, the <i>Pineta</i>, the scene of
Boccaccio's novel, and Dryden's fable of Honoria, &amp;c. &amp;c.; and I
see my Dama every day; but I feel seriously uneasy about her
health, which seems very precarious. In losing her, I should lose a
being who has run great risks on my account, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="page171" name="page171"></a>Pg 171</span> whom I have every
reason to love&mdash;but I must not think this possible. I do not know
what I <i>should</i> do if she died, but I ought to blow my brains
out&mdash;and I hope that I should. Her husband is a very polite
personage, but I wish he would not carry me out in his coach and
six, like Whittington and his cat.</p>

encouragement do you give me, all of you, with your nonsensical

Mr. Kinnaird to speak to you on a little matter of business; either
he has not spoken, or you have not answered. You are a pretty pair,

obstinate cough of the lungs, and occasional fever, &amp;c. &amp;c. and
there are latent causes of an eruption in the skin, which she
foolishly repelled into the system two years ago: but I have made
them send her case to Aglietti; and have begged him to come&mdash;if
only for a day or two&mdash;to consult upon her state.</p>

present Amica, I have done with the passion for ever&mdash;it is my
<i>last</i> love. As to libertinism, I have sickened myself of that, as
was natural in the way I went on, and I have at least derived that
advantage from vice, to <i>love</i> in the better sense of the word.
<i>This</i> will be my last adventure&mdash;I can hope no more to inspire
attachment, and I trust never again to feel it."</p></div>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>The impression which, I think, cannot but be entertained, from some
passages of these letters, of<span class="pagenum"><a id="page174" name="page174"></a>Pg 174</span> the real fervour and sincerity of his
attachment to Madame Guiccioli<a name="FNanchor_41_41" id="FNanchor_41_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a>, would be still further confirmed by
the perusal of his letters to that lady herself, both from Venice and
during his present stay at Ravenna&mdash;all bearing, throughout, the true
marks both of affection and passion. Such effusions, however, are but
little suited to the general eye. It is the tendency of all strong
feeling, from dwelling constantly on the same idea, to be monotonous;
and those often-repeated vows and verbal endearments, which make the
charm of true love-letters to the parties concerned in them, must for
ever render even the best of them cloying to others. Those of Lord Byron
to Madame Guiccioli, which are for the most part in Italian, and written
with a degree of ease and cor<span class="pagenum"><a id="page175" name="page175"></a>Pg 175</span>rectness attained rarely by foreigners,
refer chiefly to the difficulties thrown in the way of their
meetings,&mdash;not so much by the husband himself, who appears to have liked
and courted Lord Byron's society, as by the watchfulness of other
relatives, and the apprehension felt by themselves lest their intimacy
should give uneasiness to the father of the lady, Count Gamba, a
gentleman to whose good nature and amiableness of character all who know
him bear testimony.</p>

<p>In the near approaching departure of the young Countess for Bologna,
Lord Byron foresaw a risk of their being again separated; and under the
impatience of this prospect, though through the whole of his preceding
letters the fear of committing her by any imprudence seems to have been
his ruling thought, he now, with that wilfulness of the moment which has
so often sealed the destiny of years, proposed that she should, at once,
abandon her husband and fly with him:&mdash;"c'&egrave; uno solo rimedio efficace,"
he says,&mdash;"cio&egrave; d' andar vi&agrave; insieme." To an Italian wife, almost every
thing but this is permissible. The same system which so indulgently
allows her a friend, as one of the regular appendages of her matrimonial
establishment, takes care also to guard against all unseemly
consequences of this privilege; and in return for such convenient
facilities of wrong exacts rigidly an observance of all the appearances
of right. Accordingly, the open step of deserting the husband for the
lover instead of being considered, as in England, but a sign and sequel
of transgression, takes rank, in Italian morality, as the main
transgres<span class="pagenum"><a id="page176" name="page176"></a>Pg 176</span>sion itself; and being an offence, too, rendered wholly
unnecessary by the latitude otherwise enjoyed, becomes, from its rare
occurrence, no less monstrous than odious.</p>

<p>The proposition, therefore, of her noble friend seemed to the young
Contessa little less than sacrilege, and the agitation of her mind,
between the horrors of such a step, and her eager readiness to give up
all and every thing for him she adored, was depicted most strongly in
her answer to the proposal. In a subsequent letter, too, the romantic
girl even proposed, as a means of escaping the ignominy of an elopement,
that she should, like another Juliet, "pass for dead,"&mdash;assuring him
that there were many easy ways of effecting such a deception.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Ravenna, August 1. 1819.</p>

<p>[Address your Answer to Venice, however.]</p>

<p>"Don't be alarmed. You will see me defend myself gaily&mdash;that is, if
I happen to be in spirits; and by spirits, I don't mean your
meaning of the word, but the spirit of a bull-dog when pinched, or
a bull when pinned; it is then that they make best sport; and as my
sensations under an attack are probably a happy compound of the
united energies of these amiable animals, you may perhaps see what
Marrall calls 'rare sport,' and some good tossing and goring, in
the course of the controversy. But I must be in the right cue
first, and I doubt I am almost too far off to be in a sufficient
fury for the<span class="pagenum"><a id="page177" name="page177"></a>Pg 177</span> purpose. And then I have effeminated and enervated
myself with love and the summer in these last two months.</p>

<p>"I wrote to Mr. Hobhouse, the other day, and foretold that Juan
would either fall entirely or succeed completely; there will be no
medium. Appearances are not favourable; but as you write the day
after publication, it can hardly be decided what opinion will
predominate. You seem in a fright, and doubtless with cause. Come
what may I never will flatter the million's canting in any shape.
Circumstances may or may not have placed me at times in a situation
to lead the public opinion, but the public opinion never led, nor
ever shall lead, me. I will not sit on a degraded throne; so pray
put Messrs. * * or * *, or Tom Moore, or * * * upon it; they will
all of them be transported with their coronation.</p>

<p>"P.S. The Countess Guiccioli is much better than she was. I sent
you, before leaving Venice, the real original sketch which gave
rise to the 'Vampire,' &amp;c.&mdash;Did you get it?"</p></div>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>This letter was, of course (like most of those he addressed to England
at this time), intended to be shown; and having been, among others,
permitted to see it, I took occasion, in my very next communication to
Lord Byron, to twit him a little with the passage in it relating to
myself,&mdash;the only one, as far as I can learn, that ever fell from my
noble friend's pen during our intimacy, in which he has spoken of me
otherwise than in terms of kindness<span class="pagenum"><a id="page178" name="page178"></a>Pg 178</span> and the most undeserved praise.
Transcribing his own words, as well as I could recollect them, at the
top of my letter, I added, underneath, "Is <i>this</i> the way you speak of
your friends?" Not long after, too, when visiting him at Venice, I
remember making the same harmless little sneer a subject of raillery
with him; but he declared boldly that he had no recollection of having
ever written such words, and that, if they existed, "he must have been
half asleep when he wrote them."</p>

<p>I have mentioned the circumstance merely for the purpose of remarking,
that with a sensibility vulnerable at so many points as his was, and
acted upon by an imagination so long practised in self-tormenting, it is
only wonderful that, thinking constantly, as his letters prove him to
have been, of distant friends, and receiving from few or none equal
proofs of thoughtfulness in return, he should not more frequently have
broken out into such sallies against the absent and "unreplying." For
myself, I can only say that, from the moment I began to unravel his
character, the most slighting and even acrimonious expressions that I
could have heard he had, in a fit of spleen, uttered against me, would
have no more altered my opinion of his disposition, nor disturbed my
affection for him, than the momentary clouding over of a bright sky
could leave an impression on the mind of gloom, after its shadow had
passed away.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page179" name="page179"></a>Pg 179</span></p>

Pray inform me.</p>

<p>"Of Don Juan I hear nothing further from you; * * *, but the papers

I will write a preface that <i>shall</i> exculpate <i>you</i> and * * *, &amp;c.

<p>"I do not know how far I may be able to reply to your letter, for I
am not very well to-day. Last night I went to the representation of
Alfieri's Mirra, the two last acts of which threw me into
convulsions. I do not mean by that word a lady's hysterics, but the
agony of reluctant tears, and the choking shudder, which I do not
often undergo for fiction. This is but the second time for any
thing under reality: the first was on seeing Kean's Sir Giles
Overreach. The worst was, that the 'Dama' in whose box I was, went
off in the same way, I really believe more from fright than any
other sympathy&mdash;at least with the players: but she has been ill,
and I have been ill, and we are all languid and pathetic this
morning, with great expenditure of sal volatile.<a name="FNanchor_42_42" id="FNanchor_42_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a> But, to return
to your letter of the 23d of July.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page181" name="page181"></a>Pg 181</span></p>

<p>"You are right, Gifford is right, Crabbe is right, Hobhouse is
right&mdash;you are all right, and I am all wrong; but do, pray, let me
have that pleasure. Cut me up root and branch; quarter me in the
Quarterly; send round my 'disjecti membra poet&aelig;,' like those of
the Levite's concubine; make me, if you will, a spectacle to men
and angels; but don't ask me to alter, for I won't:&mdash;I am obstinate
and lazy&mdash;and there's the truth.</p>

<p>"But, nevertheless, I will answer your friend P * *, who objects to
the quick succession of fun and gravity, as if in that case the
gravity did not (in intention, at least) heighten the fun. His
metaphor is, that 'we are never scorched and drenched at the<span class="pagenum"><a id="page182" name="page182"></a>Pg 182</span> same
time.' Blessings on his experience! Ask him these questions about
'scorching and drenching.' Did he never play at cricket, or walk a
mile in hot weather? Did he never spill a dish of tea over himself
in handing the cup to his charmer, to the great shame of his
nankeen breeches? Did he never swim in the sea at noonday with the
sun in his eyes and on his head, which all the foam of ocean could
not cool? Did he never draw his foot out of too hot water,
d&mdash;&mdash;ning his eyes and his valet's? Did he never tumble into a
river or lake, fishing, and sit in his wet clothes in the boat, or
on the bank, afterwards 'scorched and drenched,' like a true
sportsman? 'Oh for breath to utter!'&mdash;but make him my compliments;
he is a clever fellow for all that&mdash;a very clever fellow.</p>

<p>"You ask me for the plan of Donny Johnny: I <i>have</i> no plan; I <i>had</i>
no plan; but I had or have materials; though if, like Tony Lumpkin,
'I am to be snubbed so when I am in spirits,' the poem will be
naught, and the poet turn serious again. If it don't take, I will
leave it off where it is, with all due respect to the public; but
if continued, it must be in my own way. You might as well make
Hamlet (or Diggory) 'act mad' in a strait waistcoat as trammel my
buffoonery, if I am to be a buffoon; their gestures and my thoughts
would only be pitiably absurd and ludicrously constrained. Why,
man, the soul of such writing is its licence; at least the
<i>liberty</i> of that <i>licence</i>, if one likes&mdash;<i>not</i> that one should
abuse it. It is like Trial by Jury and Peerage and the Habeas
Corpus&mdash;a very fine thing,<span class="pagenum"><a id="page183" name="page183"></a>Pg 183</span> but chiefly in the <i>reversion;</i> because
no one wishes to be tried for the mere pleasure of proving his
possession of the privilege.</p>

<p>"But a truce with these reflections. You are too earnest and eager
about a work never intended to be serious. Do you suppose that I
could have any intention but to giggle and make giggle?&mdash;a playful
satire, with as little poetry as could be helped, was what I meant.
And as to the indecency, do, pray, read in Boswell what <i>Johnson</i>,
the sullen moralist, says of <i>Prior</i> and Paulo Purgante.</p>

<p>"Will you get a favour done for me? <i>You</i> can, by your government
friends, Croker, Canning, or my old schoolfellow Peel, and I can't.
Here it is. Will you ask them to appoint (<i>without salary or
emolument</i>) a noble Italian (whom I will name afterwards) consul or
vice-consul for Ravenna? He is a man of very large
property,&mdash;noble, too; but he wishes to have a British protection,
in case of changes. Ravenna is near the sea. He wants no
<i>emolument</i> whatever. That his office might be useful, I know; as I
lately sent off from Ravenna to Trieste a poor devil of an English
sailor, who had remained there sick, sorry, and pennyless (having
been set ashore in 1814), from the want of any accredited agent
able or willing to help him homewards. Will you get this done? If
you do, I will then send his name and condition, subject, of
course, to rejection, if <i>not</i> approved when known.</p>

<p>"I know that in the Levant you make consuls and vice-consuls,
perpetually, of foreigners. This man is a patrician, and has twelve
thousand a year.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page184" name="page184"></a>Pg 184</span> His motive is a British protection in case of new
invasions. Don't you think Croker would do it for us? To be sure,
my <i>interest</i> is rare!! but, perhaps, a brother wit in the Tory
line might do a good turn at the request of so harmless and long
absent a Whig, particularly as there is no <i>salary</i> or <i>burden</i> of
any sort to be annexed to the office.</p>

<p>"I can assure you, I should look upon it as a great obligation;
but, alas! that very circumstance may, very probably, operate to
the contrary&mdash;indeed, it ought; but I have, at least, been an
honest and an open enemy. Amongst your many splendid government
connections, could not you, think you, get our Bibulus made a
Consul? or make me one, that I may make him my Vice. You may be
assured that, in case of accidents in Italy, he would be no feeble
adjunct&mdash;as you would think, if you knew his patrimony.</p>

<p>"What is all this about Tom Moore? but why do I ask? since the
state of my own affairs would not permit me to be of use to him,
though they are greatly improved since 1816, and may, with some
more luck and a little prudence, become quite clear. It seems his
claimants are <i>American</i> merchants? <i>There goes Nemesis!</i> Moore
abused America. It is always thus in the long run:&mdash;Time, the
Avenger. You have seen every trampler down, in turn, from
Buonaparte to the simplest individuals. You saw how some were
avenged even upon my insignificance, and how in turn * * * paid for
his atrocity. It is an odd world; but the watch has its mainspring,

taking the charge as serious, and, in his succeeding number, came forth
with an indignant contradiction of it. To this tempting subject the
letter, written so hastily off at Bologna, related; but, though printed
for Mr. Murray, in a pamphlet consisting of twenty-three pages, it was
never published by him.<a name="FNanchor_43_43" id="FNanchor_43_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a> Being valuable, however, as one of the best
specimens we have of Lord Byron's simple and thoroughly English prose, I
shall here preserve some extracts from it.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>"<b>TO THE EDITOR OF THE BRITISH REVIEW.</b></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"My dear R&mdash;&mdash;ts,</p>

<p>"As a believer in the Church of England&mdash;to say nothing of the
State&mdash;I have been an occasional reader, and great admirer, though
not a subscriber, to your Review. But I do not know that any
article of its contents ever gave me much surprise till the
eleventh of your late twenty-seventh number made its appearance.
You have there most manfully refuted a calumnious accusation of
bribery and corruption, the credence of which in the public mind<span class="pagenum"><a id="page188" name="page188"></a>Pg 188</span>
might not only have damaged your reputation as a clergyman and an
editor, but, what would have been still worse, have injured the
circulation of your journal; which, I regret to hear, is not so
extensive as the 'purity (as you well observe) of its, &amp;c. &amp;c.' and
the present taste for propriety, would induce us to expect. The
charge itself is of a solemn nature; and, although in verse, is
couched in terms of such circumstantial gravity as to induce a
belief little short of that generally accorded to the thirty-nine
articles, to which you so generously subscribed on taking your
degrees. It is a charge the most revolting to the heart of man from
its frequent occurrence; to the mind of a statesman from its
occasional truth; and to the soul of an editor from its moral
impossibility. You are charged then in the last line of one octave
stanza, and the whole eight lines of the next, viz. 209th and 210th
of the first Canto of that 'pestilent poem,' Don Juan, with
receiving, and still more foolishly acknowledging, the receipt of
certain moneys to eulogise the unknown author, who by this account
must be known to you, if to nobody else. An impeachment of this
nature, so seriously made, there is but one way of refuting; and it
is my firm persuasion, that whether you did or did not (and <i>I</i>
believe that you did not) receive the said moneys, of which I wish
that he had specified the sum, you are quite right in denying all
knowledge of the transaction. If charges of this nefarious
description are to go forth, sanctioned by all the solemnity of
circumstance, and guaranteed by the veracity of verse (as
Counsellor Phillips would<span class="pagenum"><a id="page189" name="page189"></a>Pg 189</span> say), what is to become of readers
hitherto implicitly confident in the not less veracious prose of
our critical journals? what is to become of the reviews; and, if
the reviews fail, what is to become of the editors? It is common
cause, and you have done well to sound the alarm. I myself, in my
humble sphere, will be one of your echoes. In the words of the
tragedian Liston, 'I love a row,' and you seem justly determined to
make one.</p>

<p>"It is barely possible, certainly improbable, that the writer might
have been in jest; but this only aggravates his crime. A joke, the
proverb says, 'breaks no bones;' but it may break a bookseller, or
it may be the cause of bones being broken. The jest is but a bad
one at the best for the author, and might have been a still worse
one for you, if your copious contradiction did not certify to all
whom it may concern your own indignant innocence, and the
immaculate purity of the British Review. I do not doubt your word,
my dear R&mdash;&mdash;ts, yet I cannot help wishing that, in a case of such
vital importance, it had assumed the more substantial shape of an
affidavit sworn before the Lord Mayor Atkins, who readily receives
any deposition; and doubtless would have brought it in some way as
evidence of the designs of the Reformers to set fire to London, at
the same time that he himself meditates the same good office
towards the river Thames.</p>

<p>"I recollect hearing, soon after the publication, this subject
discussed at the tea-table of Mr. * * * the poet,&mdash;and Mrs. and the
Misses * * * * * being in a corner of the room perusing the proof
sheets of<span class="pagenum"><a id="page190" name="page190"></a>Pg 190</span> Mr. * * *'s poems, the male part of the <i>conversazione</i>
were at liberty to make some observations on the poem and passage
in question, and there was a difference of opinion. Some thought
the allusion was to the 'British Critic;' others, that by the
expression 'My Grandmother's Review,' it was intimated that 'my
grandmother' was not the reader of the review, but actually the
writer; thereby insinuating, my dear Mr. R&mdash;&mdash;ts, that you were an
old woman; because, as people often say, 'Jeffrey's Review,"
'Gifford's Review,' in lieu of Edinburgh and Quarterly, so 'My
Grandmother's Review' and R&mdash;&mdash;ts's might be also synonymous. Now,
whatever colour this insinuation might derive from the circumstance
of your wearing a gown, as well as from your time of life, your
general style, and various passages of your writings,&mdash;I will take
upon myself to exculpate you from all suspicion of the kind, and
assert, without calling Mrs. R&mdash;&mdash;ts in testimony, that if ever you
should be chosen Pope, you will pass through all the previous
ceremonies with as much credit as any pontiff since the parturition
of Joan. It is very unfair to judge of sex from writings,
particularly from those of the British Review. We are all liable to
be deceived, and it is an indisputable fact that many of the best
articles in your journal, which were attributed to a veteran
female, were actually written by you yourself, and yet to this day
there are people who could never find out the difference. But let
us return to the more immediate question.</p>

<p>"I agree with you that it is impossible Lord B. should be the
author, not only because, as a British<span class="pagenum"><a id="page191" name="page191"></a>Pg 191</span> peer and a British poet, it
would be impracticable for him to have recourse to such facetious
fiction, but for some other reasons which you have omitted to
state. In the first place, his Lordship has no grandmother. Now the
author&mdash;and we may believe him in this&mdash;doth expressly state that
the 'British' is his 'Grandmother's Review;' and if, as I think I
have distinctly proved, this was not a mere figurative allusion to
your supposed intellectual age and sex, my dear friend, it follows,
whether you be she or no, that there is such an elderly lady still
extant.</p>

<p>"Shall I give you what I think a prudent opinion? I don't mean to
insinuate, God forbid! but if, by any accident, there should have
been such a correspondence between you and the unknown author,
whoever he may be, send him back his money; I dare say he will be
very glad to have it again; it can't be much, considering the value
of the article and the circulation of the journal; and you are too
modest to rate your praise beyond its real worth:&mdash;don't be angry,
I know you won't, at this appraisement of your powers of eulogy:
for on the other hand, my dear fellow, depend upon it your abuse is
worth, not its own weight, that's a feather, but <i>your</i> weight in
gold. So don't spare it; if he has bargained for <i>that</i>, give it
handsomely, and depend upon your doing him a friendly office.</p>

<p>"What the motives of this writer may have been for (as you
magnificently translate his quizzing you) 'stating, with the
particularity which belongs to fact, the forgery of a groundless
fiction,' (do, pray,<span class="pagenum"><a id="page192" name="page192"></a>Pg 192</span> my dear R., talk a little less 'in King
Cambyses' vein,') I cannot pretend to say; perhaps to laugh at you,
but that is no reason for your benevolently making all the world
laugh also. I approve of your being angry, I tell you I am angry
too, but you should not have shown it so outrageously. Your solemn
'<i>if</i> somebody personating the Editor of the, &amp;c. &amp;c. has received
from Lord B. or from any other person,' reminds me of Charley
Incledon's usual exordium when people came into the tavern to hear
him sing without paying their share of the reckoning&mdash;'if a maun,
or <i>ony</i> maun, or <i>ony other</i> maun,' &amp;c. &amp;c.; you have both the
same redundant eloquence. But why should you think any body would
personate you? Nobody would dream of such a prank who ever read
your compositions, and perhaps not many who have heard your
conversation. But I have been inoculated with a little of your
prolixity. The fact is, my dear R&mdash;&mdash;ts, that somebody has tried to
make a fool of you, and what he did not succeed in doing, you have
done for him and for yourself."</p></div>

<p>Towards the latter end of August, Count Guiccioli, accompanied by his
lady, went for a short time to visit some of his Romagnese estates,
while Lord Byron remained at Bologna alone. And here, with a heart
softened and excited by the new feeling that had taken possession of
him, he appears to have given himself up, during this interval of
solitude, to a train of melancholy and impassioned thought, such as, for
a time, brought back all the romance of his youth<span class="pagenum"><a id="page193" name="page193"></a>Pg 193</span>ful days. That spring
of natural tenderness within his soul, which neither the world's efforts
nor his own had been able to chill or choke up, was now, with something
of its first freshness, set flowing once more. He again knew what it was
to love and be loved,&mdash;too late, it is true, for happiness, and too
wrongly for peace, but with devotion enough, on the part of the woman,
to satisfy even his thirst for affection, and with a sad earnestness, on
his own, a foreboding fidelity, which made him cling but the more
passionately to this attachment from feeling that it would be his last.</p>

<p>A circumstance which he himself used to mention as having occurred at
this period will show how over-powering, at times, was the rush of
melancholy over his heart. It was his fancy, during Madame Guiccioli's
absence from Bologna, to go daily to her house at his usual hour of
visiting her, and there, causing her apartments to be opened, to sit
turning over her books, and writing in them.<a name="FNanchor_44_44" id="FNanchor_44_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a> He would<span class="pagenum"><a id="page194" name="page194"></a>Pg 194</span> then descend
into her garden, where he passed hours in musing; and it was on an
occasion of this kind, as he stood looking, in a state of unconscious
reverie, into one of those fountains so common in the gardens of Italy,
that there came suddenly into his mind such desolate fancies, such
bodings of the misery he might bring on her he loved, by that doom which
(as he has himself written) "makes it fatal to be loved<a name="FNanchor_45_45" id="FNanchor_45_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a>," that,
overwhelmed with his own thoughts, he burst into an agony of tears.</p>

<p>During the same few days it was that he wrote in the last page of Madame
Guiccioli's copy of "Corinne" the following remarkable note:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"My dearest Teresa,&mdash;I have read this book in your garden;&mdash;my
love, you were absent, or else I could not have read it. It is a
favourite book of yours, and the writer was a friend of mine. You
will not understand these English words, and <i>others</i> will not
understand them&mdash;which is the reason I have not scrawled them in
Italian. But you will recognise the hand-writing of him who
passionately loved you, and you will divine that, over a book which
was yours, he could only think of love. In<span class="pagenum"><a id="page195" name="page195"></a>Pg 195</span> that word, beautiful in
all languages, but most so in yours&mdash;<i>Amor mio</i>&mdash;is comprised my
existence here and hereafter. I feel I exist here, and I fear that
I shall exist hereafter,&mdash;to <i>what</i> purpose you will decide; my
destiny rests with you, and you are a woman, seventeen years of
age, and two out of a convent. I wish that you had stayed there,
with all my heart,&mdash;or, at least, that I had never met you in your
married state.</p>

<p>"But all this is too late. I love you, and you love me,&mdash;at least,
you <i>say so</i>, and <i>act</i> as if you <i>did</i> so, which last is a great
consolation in all events. But <i>I</i> more than love you, and cannot
cease to love you.</p>

<p>"Think of me, sometimes, when the Alps and the ocean divide
us,&mdash;but they never will, unless you <i>wish</i> it. BYRON.</p>

<p><b>LETTER 339. TO MR. MURRAY.</b></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Bologna, August 24. 1819.</p>

<p>"I wrote to you by last post, enclosing a buffooning letter for
publication, addressed to the buffoon R&mdash;&mdash;ts, who has thought
proper to tie a canister to his own tail. It was written off-hand,
and in the midst of circumstances not very favourable to
facetiousness, so that there may, perhaps, be more bitterness than
enough for that sort of small acid punch:&mdash;you will tell me.</p>

<p>"Keep the anonymous, in any case: it helps what fun there may be.
But if the matter grow serious<span class="pagenum"><a id="page196" name="page196"></a>Pg 196</span> about <i>Don Juan</i>, and you feel
<i>yourself</i> in a scrape, or <i>me</i> either, <i>own that I am the author.</i>
<i>I</i> will never <i>shrink</i>; and if <i>you</i> do, I can always answer you
in the question of Guatimozin to his minister&mdash;each being on his
own coals.<a name="FNanchor_46_46" id="FNanchor_46_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a></p>

<p>"I wish that I had been in better spirits; but I am out of sorts,
out of nerves, and now and then (I begin to fear) out of my senses.
All this Italy has done for me, and not England: I defy all you,
and your climate to boot, to make me mad. But if ever I do really
become a bedlamite, and wear a strait waistcoat, let me be brought
back among you; your people will then be proper company.</p>

<p>"I assure you what I here say and feel has nothing to do with
England, either in a literary or personal point of view. All my
present pleasures or plagues are as Italian as the opera. And after
all, they are but trifles; for all this arises from my 'Dama's'
being in the country for three days (at Capo-fiume). But as I could
never live but for one human being at a time, (and, I assure you,
<i>that one</i> has never been <i>myself</i>, as you may know by the
consequences, for the <i>selfish</i> are <i>successful</i> in life,) I feel
alone and unhappy.</p>

<p>"I have sent for my daughter from Venice, and I ride daily, and
walk in a garden, under a purple canopy of grapes, and sit by a
fountain, and talk with the gardener of his tools, which seem
greater than Adam's, and with his wife, and with his son's wife,
who is the youngest of the party, and, I think, talks<span class="pagenum"><a id="page197" name="page197"></a>Pg 197</span> best of the
three. Then I revisit the Campo Santo, and my old friend, the
sexton, has two&mdash;but <i>one</i> the prettiest daughter imaginable; and I
amuse myself with contrasting her beautiful and innocent face of
fifteen with the skulls with which he has peopled several cells,
and particularly with that of one skull dated 1766, which was once
covered (the tradition goes) by the most lovely features of
Bologna&mdash;noble and rich. When I look at these, and at this
girl&mdash;when I think of what <i>they were</i>, and what she must be&mdash;why,
then, my dear Murray, I won't shock you by saying what I think. It
is little matter what becomes of us 'bearded men,' but I don't like
the notion of a beautiful woman's lasting less than a beautiful
tree&mdash;than her own picture&mdash;her own shadow, which won't change so
to the sun as her face to the mirror. I must leave off, for my head
aches consumedly. I have never been quite well since the night of
the representation of Alfieri's Mirra, a fortnight ago. Yours
ever."</p></div>

<p><b>LETTER 340. TO MR. MURRAY.</b></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Bologna, August 29. 1819.</p>

<p>"I have been in a rage these two days, and am still bilious
therefrom. You shall hear. A captain of dragoons, * *, Hanoverian
by birth, in the Papal troops at present, whom I had obliged by a
loan when nobody would lend him a paul, recommended a horse to me,
on sale by a Lieutenant * *, an officer who unites the sale of
cattle to the purchase of men. I bought it. The next day, on
shoeing the horse, we<span class="pagenum"><a id="page198" name="page198"></a>Pg 198</span> discovered the <i>thrush</i>,&mdash;the animal being
warranted sound. I sent to reclaim the contract and the money. The
lieutenant desired to speak with me in person. I consented. He
came. It was his own particular request. He began a story. I asked
him if he would return the money. He said no&mdash;but he would
exchange. He asked an exorbitant price for his other horses. I told
him that he was a thief. He said he was an <i>officer</i> and a man of
honour, and pulled out a Parmesan passport signed by General Count
Neifperg. I answered, that as he was an officer, I would treat him
as such; and that as to his being a gentleman, he might prove it by
returning the money: as for his Parmesan passport, I should have
valued it more if it had been a Parmesan cheese. He answered in
high terms, and said that if it were the <i>morning</i> (it was about
eight o'clock in the evening) he would have <i>satisfaction</i>. I then
lost my temper: 'As for THAT,' I replied, 'you shall have it
directly,&mdash;it will be <i>mutual</i> satisfaction, I can assure you. You
are a thief, and, as you say, an officer; my pistols are in the
next room loaded; take one of the candles, examine, and make your
choice of weapons.' He replied, that <i>pistols</i> were <i>English
weapons</i>; <i>he</i> always fought with the <i>sword</i>. I told him that I
was able to accommodate him, having three regimental swords in a
drawer near us: and he might take the longest and put himself on
guard.</p>

<p>"All this passed in presence of a third person. He then said <i>No</i>;
but to-morrow morning he would give me the meeting at any time or
place. I answered that it was not usual to appoint meetings<span class="pagenum"><a id="page199" name="page199"></a>Pg 199</span> in the
presence of witnesses, and that we had best speak man to man, and
appoint time and instruments. But as the man present was leaving
the room, the Lieutenant * *, before he could shut the door after
him, ran out roaring 'Help and murder' most lustily, and fell into
a sort of hysteric in the arms of about fifty people, who all saw
that I had no weapon of any sort or kind about me, and followed
him, asking him what the devil was the matter with him. Nothing
would do: he ran away without his hat, and went to bed, ill of the
fright. He then tried his complaint at the police, which dismissed
it as frivolous. He is, I believe, gone away, or going.</p>

<p>"The horse was warranted, but, I believe, so worded that the
villain will not be obliged to refund, according to law. He
endeavoured to raise up an indictment of assault and battery, but
as it was in a public inn, in a frequented street, there were too
many witnesses to the contrary; and, as a military man, he has not
cut a martial figure, even in the opinion of the priests. He ran
off in such a hurry that he left his hat, and never missed it till
he got to his hostel or inn. The facts are as I tell you, I can
assure you. He began by 'coming Captain Grand over me,' or I should
never have thought of trying his 'cunning in fence.' But what could
I do? He talked of 'honour, and satisfaction, and his commission;'
he produced a military passport; there are severe punishments for
<i>regular duels</i> on the Continent, and trifling ones for
<i>rencontres</i>, so that it is best to fight it out directly; he had
robbed, and then wanted to insult me;&mdash;what could I do? My
patience<span class="pagenum"><a id="page200" name="page200"></a>Pg 200</span> was gone, and the weapons at hand, fair and equal.
Besides, it was just after dinner, when my digestion was bad, and I
don't like to be disturbed. His friend * * is at Forli; we shall
meet on my way back to Ravenna. The Hanoverian seems the greater
rogue of the two; and if my valour does not ooze away like
Acres's&mdash;'Odds flints and triggers!' if it should be a rainy
morning, and my stomach in disorder, there may be something for the
obituary.</p>

<p>"Now pray, 'Sir Lucius, do not you look upon me as a very ill-used
gentleman?' I send my Lieutenant to match Mr. Hobhouse's Major
Cartwright: and so 'good morrow to you, good master Lieutenant.'
With regard to other things I will write soon, but I have been
quarrelling and fooling till I can scribble no more."</p></div>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>In the month of September, Count Guiccioli, being called away by
business to Ravenna, left his young Countess and her lover to the free
enjoyment of each other's society at Bologna. The lady's ill health,
which had been the cause of her thus remaining behind, was thought, soon
after, to require the still further advantage of a removal to Venice;
and the Count her husband, being written to on the subject, consented,
with the most complaisant readiness, that she should proceed thither in
company with Lord Byron. "Some business" (says the lady's own Memoir)
"having called Count Guiccioli to Ravenna, I was obliged, by the state
of my health, instead of accompanying him, to return to Venice, and he
consented that Lord Byron should be the companion of my journey. We left
Bologna on the<span class="pagenum"><a id="page201" name="page201"></a>Pg 201</span> fifteenth of September: we visited the Euganean Hills
and Arqu&agrave;, and wrote our names in the book which is presented to those
who make this pilgrimage. But I cannot linger over these recollections
of happiness;&mdash;the contrast with the present is too dreadful. If a
blessed spirit, while in the full enjoyment of heavenly happiness, were
sent down to this earth to suffer all its miseries, the contrast could
not be more dreadful between the past and the present, than what I have
endured from the moment when that terrible word reached my ears, and I
for ever lost the hope of again beholding him, one look from whom I
valued beyond earth's all happiness. When I arrived at Venice, the
physicians ordered that I should try the country air, and Lord Byron,
having a villa at La Mira, gave it up to me, and came to reside there
with me. At this place we passed the autumn, and there I had the
pleasure of forming your acquaintance."<a name="FNanchor_47_47" id="FNanchor_47_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a></p><p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page202" name="page202"></a>Pg 202</span></p>

<p>It was my good fortune, at this period, in the course of a short and
hasty tour through the north of Italy, to pass five or six days with
Lord Byron at Venice. I had written to him on my way thither to announce
my coming, and to say how happy it would make me could I tempt him to
accompany me as far as Rome.</p>

<p>During my stay at Geneva, an opportunity had been afforded me of
observing the exceeding readiness with which even persons the least
disposed to be prejudiced gave an ear to any story relating to Lord
Byron, in which the proper portions of odium and romance were but
plausibly mingled. In the course of conversation, one day, with the late
amiable and enlightened Monsieur D * *, that gentleman related, with
much feeling, to my fellow-traveller and myself, the details of a late
act of seduction of which Lord Byron had, he said, been guilty, and
which was made to comprise within itself all the worst features of such
unmanly frauds upon innocence;&mdash;the victim, a young unmarried lady, of
one of the first families of Venice, whom the noble seducer had lured
from her father's house to his own, and, after a few weeks, most
inhumanly turned her out of doors. In vain, said the relator, did she
entreat to become his servant, his slave;&mdash;<span class="pagenum"><a id="page203" name="page203"></a>Pg 203</span>in vain did she ask to
remain in some dark corner of his mansion, from which she might be able
to catch a glimpse of his form as he passed. Her betrayer was obdurate,
and the unfortunate young lady, in despair at being thus abandoned by
him, threw herself into the canal, from which she was taken out but to
be consigned to a mad-house. Though convinced that there must be
considerable exaggeration in this story, it was only on my arrival at
Venice I ascertained that the whole was a romance; and that out of the
circumstances (already laid before the reader) connected with Lord
Byron's fantastic and, it must be owned, discreditable fancy for the
Fornarina, this pathetic tale, so implicitly believed at Geneva, was
fabricated.</p>

<p>Having parted at Milan, with Lord John Russell, whom I had accompanied
from England, and whom I was to rejoin, after a short visit to Rome, at
Genoa, I made purchase of a small and (as it soon proved) crazy
travelling carriage, and proceeded alone on my way to Venice. My time
being limited, I stopped no longer at the intervening places than was
sufficient to hurry over their respective wonders, and, leaving Padua at
noon on the 8th of October, I found myself, about two o'clock, at the
door of my friend's villa, at La Mira. He was but just up, and in his
bath; but the servant having announced my arrival, he returned a message
that, if I would wait till he was dressed, he would accompany me to
Venice. The interval I employed in conversing with my old acquaintance,
Fletcher, and in viewing, under his guidance, some of the apartments of
the villa.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page204" name="page204"></a>Pg 204</span></p>

<p>It was not long before Lord Byron himself made his appearance; and the
delight I felt in meeting him once more, after a separation of so many
years, was not a little heightened by observing that his pleasure was,
to the full, as great, while it was rendered doubly touching by the
evident rarity of such meetings to him of late, and the frank outbreak
of cordiality and gaiety with which he gave way to his feelings. It
would be impossible, indeed, to convey to those who have not, at some
time or other, felt the charm of his manner, any idea of what it could
be when under the influence of such pleasurable excitement as it was
most flatteringly evident he experienced at this moment.</p>

<p>I was a good deal struck, however, by the alteration that had taken
place in his personal appearance. He had grown fatter both in person and
face, and the latter had most suffered by the change,&mdash;having lost, by
the enlargement of the features, some of that refined and spiritualised
look that had, in other times, distinguished it. The addition of
whiskers, too, which he had not long before been induced to adopt, from
hearing that some one had said he had a "faccia di musico," as well as
the length to which his hair grew down on his neck, and the rather
foreign air of his coat and cap,&mdash;all combined to produce that
dissimilarity to his former self I had observed in him. He was still,
however, eminently handsome: and, in exchange for whatever his features
might have lost of their high, romantic character, they had become more
fitted for the expression of that arch, waggish wisdom, that Epicurean
play of humour,<span class="pagenum"><a id="page205" name="page205"></a>Pg 205</span> which he had shown to be equally inherent in his
various and prodigally gifted nature; while, by the somewhat increased
roundness of the contours, the resemblance of his finely formed mouth
and chin to those of the Belvedere Apollo had become still more
striking.</p>

<p>His breakfast, which I found he rarely took before three or four o'clock
in the afternoon, was speedily despatched,&mdash;his habit being to eat it
standing, and the meal in general consisting of one or two raw eggs, a
cup of tea without either milk or sugar, and a bit of dry biscuit.
Before we took our departure, he presented me to the Countess Guiccioli,
who was at this time, as my readers already know, living under the same
roof with him at La Mira; and who, with a style of beauty singular in an
Italian, as being fair-complexioned and delicate, left an impression
upon my mind, during this our first short interview, of intelligence and
amiableness such as all that I have since known or heard of her has but
served to confirm.</p>

<p>We now started together, Lord Byron and myself, in my little Milanese
vehicle, for Fusina,&mdash;his portly gondolier Tita, in a rich livery and
most redundant mustachios, having seated himself on the front of the
carriage, to the no small trial of its strength, which had already once
given way, even under my own weight, between Verona and Vicenza. On our
arrival at Fusina, my noble friend, from his familiarity with all the
details of the place, had it in his power to save me both trouble and
expense in the different arrangements relative to the custom-house,
remise, &amp;c.; and the good-natured assiduity<span class="pagenum"><a id="page206" name="page206"></a>Pg 206</span> with which he bustled about
in despatching these matters, gave me an opportunity of observing, in
his use of the infirm limb, a much greater degree of activity than I had
ever before, except in sparring, witnessed.</p>

<p>As we proceeded across the Lagoon in his gondola, the sun was just
setting, and it was an evening such as Romance would have chosen for a
first sight of Venice, rising "with her tiara of bright towers" above
the wave; while, to complete, as might be imagined, the solemn interest
of the scene, I beheld it in company with him who had lately given a new
life to its glories, and sung of that fair City of the Sea thus
grandly:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">"I stood in Venice on the Bridge of Sighs;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">A palace and a prison on each hand:<br /></span>
<span class="i2">I saw from out the wave her structures rise<br /></span>
<span class="i2">As from the stroke of the enchanter's wand:<br /></span>
<span class="i2">A thousand years their cloudy wings expand<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Around me, and a dying glory smiles<br /></span>
<span class="i2">O'er the far times, when many a subject land<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Look'd to the winged lion's marble piles,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where Venice sat in state, throned in her hundred isles."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>But, whatever emotions the first sight of such a scene might, under
other circumstances, have inspired me with, the mood of mind in which I
now viewed it was altogether the very reverse of what might have been
expected. The exuberant gaiety of my companion, and the
recollections,&mdash;any thing but romantic,&mdash;into which our conversation
wandered, put at once completely to flight all poetical and historical
associations; and our course was, I am almost<span class="pagenum"><a id="page207" name="page207"></a>Pg 207</span> ashamed to say, one of
uninterrupted merriment and laughter till we found ourselves at the
steps of my friend's palazzo on the Grand Canal. All that had ever
happened, of gay or ridiculous, during our London life together,&mdash;his
scrapes and my lecturings,&mdash;our joint adventures with the Bores and
Blues, the two great enemies, as he always called them, of London
happiness,&mdash;our joyous nights together at Watier's, Kinnaird's, &amp;c. and
"that d&mdash;&mdash;d supper of Rancliffe's which <i>ought</i> to have been a
dinner,"&mdash;all was passed rapidly in review between us, and with a flow
of humour and hilarity, on his side, of which it would have been
difficult, even for persons far graver than I can pretend to be, not to
have caught the contagion.</p>

<p>He had all along expressed his determination that I should not go to any
hotel, but fix my quarters at his house during the period of my stay;
and, had he been residing there himself, such an arrangement would have
been all that I most desired. But, this not being the case, a common
hotel was, I thought, a far readier resource; and I therefore entreated
that he would allow me to order an apartment at the Gran Bretagna, which
had the reputation, I understood, of being a comfortable hotel. This,
however, he would not hear of; and, as an inducement for me to agree to
his plan, said that, as long as I chose to stay, though he should be
obliged to return to La Mira in the evenings, he would make it a point
to come to Venice every day and dine with me. As we now turned into the
dismal canal, and stopped before his damp-looking mansion, my
predilection for the Gran<span class="pagenum"><a id="page208" name="page208"></a>Pg 208</span> Bretagna returned in full force; and I again
ventured to hint that it would save an abundance of trouble to let me
proceed thither. But "No&mdash;no," he answered,&mdash;"I see you think you'll be
very uncomfortable here; but you'll find that it is not quite so bad as
you expect."</p>

<p>As I groped my way after him through the dark hall, he cried out, "Keep
clear of the dog;" and before we had proceeded many paces farther, "Take
care, or that monkey will fly at you;"&mdash;a curious proof, among many
others, of his fidelity to all the tastes of his youth, as it agrees
perfectly with the description of his life at Newstead, in 1809, and of
the sort of menagerie which his visiters had then to encounter in their
progress through his hall. Having escaped these dangers, I followed him
up the staircase to the apartment destined for me. All this time he had
been despatching servants in various directions,&mdash;one, to procure me a
<i>laquais de place</i>; another to go in quest of Mr. Alexander Scott, to
whom he wished to give me in charge; while a third was sent to order his
Segretario to come to him. "So, then, you keep a Secretary?" I said.
"Yes," he answered, "a fellow who <i>can't write</i><a name="FNanchor_48_48" id="FNanchor_48_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a>&mdash;but such are the
names these pompous people give to things."</p>

<p>When we had reached the door of the apartment it was discovered to be
locked, and, to all appearance, had been so for some time, as the key
could not be found;&mdash;a circumstance which, to my<span class="pagenum"><a id="page209" name="page209"></a>Pg 209</span> English apprehension,
naturally connected itself with notions of damp and desolation, and I
again sighed inwardly for the Gran Bretagna. Impatient at the delay of
the key, my noble host, with one of his humorous maledictions, gave a
vigorous kick to the door and burst it open; on which we at once entered
into an apartment not only spacious and elegant, but wearing an aspect
of comfort and habitableness which to a traveller's eye is as welcome as
it is rare. "Here," he said, in a voice whose every tone spoke kindness
and hospitality,&mdash;"these are the rooms I use myself, and here I mean to
establish you."</p>

<p>He had ordered dinner from some Tratteria, and while waiting its
arrival&mdash;as well as that of Mr. Alexander Scott, whom he had invited to
join us&mdash;we stood out on the balcony, in order that, before the daylight
was quite gone, I might have some glimpses of the scene which the Canal
presented. Happening to remark, in looking up at the clouds, which were
still bright in the west, that "what had struck me in Italian sunsets
was that peculiar rosy hue&mdash;" I had hardly pronounced the word "rosy,"
when Lord Byron, clapping his hand on my mouth, said, with a laugh,
"Come, d&mdash;&mdash;n it, Tom, don't be poetical." Among the few gondolas
passing at the time, there was one at some distance, in which sat two
gentlemen, who had the appearance of being English; and, observing them
to look our way, Lord Byron putting his arms a-kimbo, said with a sort
of comic swagger, "Ah! if you, John<span class="pagenum"><a id="page210" name="page210"></a>Pg 210</span> Bulls, knew who the two fellows
are, now standing up here, I think you <i>would</i> stare!"&mdash;I risk
mentioning these things, though aware how they may be turned against
myself, for the sake of the otherwise indescribable traits of manner and
character which they convey. After a very agreeable dinner, through
which the jest, the story, and the laugh were almost uninterruptedly
carried on, our noble host took leave of us to return to La Mira, while
Mr. Scott and I went to one of the theatres, to see the Ottavia of
Alfieri.</p>

<p>The ensuing evenings, during my stay, were passed much in the same
manner,&mdash;my mornings being devoted, under the kind superintendence of
Mr. Scott, to a hasty, and, I fear, unprofitable view of the treasures
of art with which Venice abounds. On the subjects of painting and
sculpture Lord Byron has, in several of his letters, expressed strongly
and, as to most persons will appear, heretically his opinions. In his
want, however, of a due appreciation of these arts, he but resembled
some of his great precursors in the field of poetry;&mdash;both Tasso and
Milton, for example, having evinced so little tendency to such
tastes<a name="FNanchor_49_49" id="FNanchor_49_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a>, that, throughout the<span class="pagenum"><a id="page211" name="page211"></a>Pg 211</span> whole of their pages, there is not, I
fear, one single allusion to any of those great masters of the pencil
and chisel, whose works, nevertheless, both had seen. That Lord Byron,
though despising the imposture and jargon with which the worship of the
Arts is, like other worships, clogged and mystified, felt deeply, more
especially in sculpture, whatever imaged forth true grace and energy,
appears from passages of his poetry, which are in every body's memory,
and not a line of which but thrills alive with a sense of grandeur and
beauty such as it never entered into the capacity of a mere connoisseur
even to conceive.</p>

<p>In reference to this subject, as we were conversing one day after dinner
about the various collections I had visited that morning, on my saying
that fearful as I was, at all times, of praising any picture, lest I
should draw upon myself the connoisseur's sneer for my pains, I would
yet, to <i>him</i>, venture to own that I had seen a picture at Milan
which&mdash;"The Hagar!" he exclaimed, eagerly interrupting me; and it was in
fact this very picture I was about to mention as having wakened in me,
by the truth of its expression, more real emotion than<span class="pagenum"><a id="page212" name="page212"></a>Pg 212</span> any I had yet
seen among the chefs-d'oeuvre of Venice. It was with no small degree of
pride and pleasure I now discovered that my noble friend had felt
equally with myself the affecting mixture of sorrow and reproach with
which the woman's eyes tell the whole story in that picture.</p>

<p>On the second evening of my stay, Lord Byron having, as before, left us
for La Mira, I most willingly accepted the offer of Mr. Scott to
introduce me to the conversazioni of the two celebrated ladies, with
whose names, as leaders of Venetian fashion, the tourists to Italy have
made every body acquainted. To the Countess A * *'s parties Lord Byron
had chiefly confined himself during the first winter he passed at
Venice; but the tone of conversation at these small meetings being much
too learned for his tastes, he was induced, the following year, to
discontinue his attendance at them, and chose, in preference, the less
erudite, but more easy, society of the Countess B * *. Of the sort of
learning sometimes displayed by the "blue" visitants at Madame A * *'s,
a circumstance mentioned by the noble poet himself may afford some idea.
The conversation happening to turn, one evening, upon the statue of
Washington, by Canova, which had been just shipped off for the United
States, Madame A * *, who was then engaged in compiling a Description
Raisonn&eacute;e of Canova's works, and was anxious for information respecting
the subject of this statue, requested that some of her learned guests
would detail to her all they knew of him. This task a Signor * * (author
of a book on Geography and Statistics) un<span class="pagenum"><a id="page213" name="page213"></a>Pg 213</span>dertook to perform, and, after
some other equally sage and authentic details, concluded by informing
her that "Washington was killed in a duel by Burke."&mdash;"What," exclaimed
Lord Byron, as he stood biting his lips with impatience during this
conversation, "what, in the name of folly, are you all thinking
of?"&mdash;for he now recollected the famous duel between Hamilton and
Colonel Burr, whom, it was evident, this learned worthy had confounded
with Washington and Burke!</p>

<p>In addition to the motives easily conceivable for exchanging such a
society for one that offered, at least, repose from such erudite
efforts, there was also another cause more immediately leading to the
discontinuance of his visits to Madame A * *. This lady, who has been
sometimes honoured with the title of "The De Sta&euml;l of Italy," had
written a book called "Portraits," containing sketches of the characters
of various persons of note; and it being her intention to introduce Lord
Byron into this assemblage, she had it intimated to his Lordship that an
article in which his portraiture had been attempted was to appear in a
new edition she was about to publish of her work. It was expected, of
course, that this intimation would awaken in him some desire to see the
sketch; but, on the contrary, he was provoking enough not to manifest
the least symptoms of curiosity. Again and again was the same hint, with
as little success, conveyed; till, at length, on finding that no
impression could be produced in this manner, a direct offer was made, in
Madame A * *'s own name, to submit the article to his perusal. He<span class="pagenum"><a id="page214" name="page214"></a>Pg 214</span> could
now contain himself no longer. With more sincerity than politeness, he
returned for answer to the lady, that he was by no means ambitious of
appearing in her work; that, from the shortness, as well as the distant
nature of their acquaintance, it was impossible she could have qualified
herself to be his portrait-painter, and that, in short, she could not
oblige him more than by committing the article to the flames.</p>

<p>Whether the tribute thus unceremoniously treated ever met the eyes of
Lord Byron, I know not; but he could hardly, I think, had he seen it,
have escaped a slight touch of remorse at having thus spurned from him a
portrait drawn in no unfriendly spirit, and, though affectedly
expressed, seizing some of the less obvious features of his
character,&mdash;as, for instance, that diffidence so little to be expected
from a career like his, with the discriminating niceness of a female
hand. The following are extracts from this Portrait:&mdash;</p>


<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"'Toi, dont le monde encore ignore le vrai nom,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Esprit myst&eacute;rieux, Mortel, Ange, ou D&eacute;mon,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Qui que tu sois, Byron, bon ou fatal g&eacute;nie,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">J'aime de tes conceits la sauvage harmonie.'<br /></span>
<span class="i0">LAMARTINE.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>"It would be to little purpose to dwell upon the mere beauty of a
countenance in which the expression of an extraordinary mind was so
conspicuous. What serenity was seated on the forehead, adorned with the
finest chestnut hair, light, curling, and disposed with such art, that
the art was hidden in the imitation of most pleasing nature! What
varied<span class="pagenum"><a id="page215" name="page215"></a>Pg 215</span> expression in his eyes! They were of the azure colour of the
heavens, from which they seemed to derive their origin. His teeth, in
form, in colour, in transparency, resembled pearls; but his cheeks were
too delicately tinged with the hue of the pale rose. His neck, which he
was in the habit of keeping uncovered as much as the usages of society
permitted, seemed to have been formed in a mould, and was very white.
His hands were as beautiful as if they had been the works of art. His
figure left nothing to be desired, particularly by those who found
rather a grace than a defect in a certain light and gentle undulation of
the person when he entered a room, and of which you hardly felt tempted
to enquire the cause. Indeed it was scarcely perceptible,&mdash;the clothes
he wore were so long.</p>

<p>"He was never seen to walk through the streets of Venice, nor along the
pleasant banks of the Brenta, where he spent some weeks of the summer;
and there are some who assert that he has never seen, excepting from a
window, the wonders of the 'Piazza di San Marco;'&mdash;so powerful in him
was the desire of not showing himself to be deformed in any part of his
person. I, however, believe that he has often gazed on those wonders,
but in the late and solitary hour, when the stupendous edifices which
surrounded him, illuminated by the soft and placid light of the moon,
appeared a thousand times more lovely.</p>

<p>"His face appeared tranquil like the ocean on a fine spring morning;
but, like it, in an instant became changed into the tempestuous and
terrible, if<span class="pagenum"><a id="page216" name="page216"></a>Pg 216</span> a passion, (a passion did I say?) a thought, a word,
occurred to disturb his mind. His eyes then lost all their sweetness,
and sparkled so that it became difficult to look on them. So rapid a
change would not have been thought possible; but it was impossible to
avoid acknowledging that the natural state of his mind was the
tempestuous.</p>

<p>"What delighted him greatly one day annoyed him the next; and whenever
he appeared constant in the practice of any habits, it arose merely from
the indifference, not to say contempt, in which he held them all:
whatever they might be, they were not worthy that he should occupy his
thoughts with them. His heart was highly sensitive, and suffered itself
to be governed in an extraordinary degree by sympathy; but his
imagination carried him away, and spoiled every thing. He believed in
presages, and delighted in the recollection that he held this belief in
common with Napoleon. It appeared that, in proportion as his
intellectual education was cultivated, his moral education was
neglected, and that he never suffered himself to know or observe other
restraints than those imposed by his inclinations. Nevertheless, who
could believe that he had a constant, and almost infantine timidity, of
which the evidences were so apparent as to render its existence
indisputable, notwithstanding the difficulty experienced in associating
with Lord Byron a sentiment which had the appearance of modesty?
Conscious as he was that, wherever he presented himself, all eyes were
fixed on him, and all lips, particularly those of the women, were opened
to say, 'There he<span class="pagenum"><a id="page217" name="page217"></a>Pg 217</span> is, that is Lord Byron,'&mdash;he necessarily found
himself in the situation of an actor obliged to sustain a character, and
to render an account, not to others (for about them he gave himself no
concern), but to himself, of his every action and word. This occasioned
him a feeling of uneasiness which was obvious to every one.</p>

<p>"He remarked on a certain subject (which in 1814 was the topic of
universal discourse) that 'the world was worth neither the trouble taken
in its conquest, nor the regret felt at its loss,' which saying (if the
worth of an expression could ever equal that of many and great actions)
would almost show the thoughts and feelings of Lord Byron to be more
stupendous and unmeasured than those of him respecting whom he spoke.</p>

<p>"His gymnastic exercises were sometimes violent, and at others almost
nothing. His body, like his spirit, readily accommodated itself to all
his inclinations. During an entire winter, he went out every morning
alone to row himself to the island of Armenians, (a small island
situated in the midst of a tranquil lake, and distant from Venice about
half a league,) to enjoy the society of those learned and hospitable
monks, and to learn their difficult language; and, in the evening,
entering again into his gondola, he went, but only for a couple of
hours, into company. A second winter, whenever the water of the lake was
violently agitated, he was observed to cross it, and landing on the
nearest <i>terra firma</i>, to fatigue at least two horses with riding.</p>

<p>"No one ever heard him utter a word of French,<span class="pagenum"><a id="page218" name="page218"></a>Pg 218</span> although he was
perfectly conversant with that language. He hated the nation and its
modern literature; in like manner, he held the modern Italian literature
in contempt, and said it possessed but one living author,&mdash;a restriction
which I know not whether to term ridiculous, or false and injurious. His
voice was sufficiently sweet and flexible. He spoke with much suavity,
if not contradicted, but rather addressed himself to his neighbour than
to the entire company.</p>

<p>"Very little food sufficed him; and he preferred fish to flesh for this
extraordinary reason, that the latter, he said, rendered him ferocious.
He disliked seeing women eat; and the cause of this extraordinary
antipathy must be sought in the dread he always had, that the notion he
loved to cherish of their perfection and almost divine nature might be
disturbed. Having always been governed by them, it would seem that his
very self-love was pleased to take refuge in the idea of their
excellence,&mdash;a sentiment which he knew how (God knows how) to reconcile
with the contempt in which, shortly afterwards, almost with the
appearance of satisfaction, he seemed to hold them. But contradictions
ought not to surprise us in characters like Lord Byron's; and then, who
does not know that the slave holds in detestation his ruler?</p>

<p>"Lord Byron disliked his countrymen, but only because he knew that his
morals were held in contempt by them. The English, themselves rigid
observers of family duties, could not pardon him the neglect of his, nor
his trampling on principles; there<span class="pagenum"><a id="page219" name="page219"></a>Pg 219</span>fore neither did he like being
presented to them, nor did they, especially when they had their wives
with them, like to cultivate his acquaintance. Still there was a strong
desire in all of them to see him, and the women in particular, who did
not dare to look at him but by stealth, said in an under voice, 'What a
pity it is!' If, however, any of his compatriots of exalted rank and of
high reputation came forward to treat him with courtesy, he showed
himself obviously flattered by it, and was greatly pleased with such
association. It seemed that to the wound which remained always open in
his ulcerated heart such soothing attentions were as drops of healing
balm, which comforted him.</p>

<p>"Speaking of his marriage,&mdash;a delicate subject, but one still agreeable
to him, if it was treated in a friendly voice,&mdash;he was greatly moved,
and said it had been the innocent cause of all his errors and all his
griefs. Of his wife he spoke with much respect and affection. He said
she was an illustrious lady, distinguished for the qualities of her
heart and understanding, and that all the fault of their cruel
separation lay with himself. Now, was such language dictated by justice
or by vanity? Does it not bring to mind the saying of Julius, that the
wife of Caesar must not even be suspected? What vanity in that saying of
Caesar! In fact, if it had not been from vanity, Lord Byron would have
admitted this to no one. Of his young daughter, his dear Ada, he spoke
with great tenderness, and seemed to be pleased at the great sacrifice
he had made in leaving her to comfort her mother. The intense hatred he<span class="pagenum"><a id="page220" name="page220"></a>Pg 220</span>
bore his mother-in-law, and a sort of Euryclea of Lady Byron, two women
to whose influence he, in a great measure, attributed her estrangement
from him,&mdash;demonstrated clearly how painful the separation was to him,
notwithstanding some bitter pleasantries which occasionally occur in his
writings against her also, dictated rather by rancour than by
indifference."</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>From the time of his misunderstanding with Madame A * * *, the visits of
the noble poet were transferred to the house of the other great rallying
point of Venetian society, Madame B * * *,&mdash;a lady in whose manners,
though she had long ceased to be young, there still lingered much of
that attaching charm, which a youth passed in successful efforts to
please seldom fails to leave behind. That those powers of pleasing, too,
were not yet gone, the fidelity of, at least, one devoted admirer
testified; nor is she supposed to have thought it impossible that Lord
Byron himself might yet be linked on at the end of that long chain of
lovers, which had, through so many years, graced the triumphs of her
beauty. If, however, there could have been, in any case, the slightest
chance of such a conquest, she had herself completely frustrated it by
introducing her distinguished visitor to Madame Guiccioli,&mdash;a step by
which she at last lost, too, even the ornament of his presence at her
parties, as in consequence of some slighting conduct, on her part,
towards his "Dama," he discontinued his attendance at her evening
assemblies, and at the time of my visit to Venice had given up society
altogether.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page221" name="page221"></a>Pg 221</span></p>

<p>I could soon collect, from the tone held respecting his conduct at
Madame B * * *'s, how subversive of all the morality of intrigue they
considered the late step of which he had been guilty in withdrawing his
acknowledged "Amica" from the protection of her husband, and placing
her, at once, under the same roof with himself. "You must really (said
the hostess herself to me) scold your friend;&mdash;till this unfortunate
affair, he conducted himself <i>so</i> well!"&mdash;a eulogy on his previous moral
conduct which, when I reported it the following day to my noble host,
provoked at once a smile and sigh from his lips.</p>

<p>The chief subject of our conversation, when alone, was his marriage, and
the load of obloquy which it had brought upon him. He was most anxious
to know the worst that had been alleged of his conduct; and as this was
our first opportunity of speaking together on the subject, I did not
hesitate to put his candour most searchingly to the proof, not only by
enumerating the various charges I had heard brought against him by
others, but by specifying such portions of these charges as I had been
inclined to think not incredible myself. To all this he listened with
patience, and answered with the most unhesitating frankness, laughing to
scorn the tales of unmanly outrage related of him, but, at the same
time, acknowledging that there had been in his conduct but too much to
blame and regret, and stating one or two occasions, during his domestic
life, when he had been irritated into letting "the breath of bitter
words" escape him,&mdash;words, rather those of the unquiet spirit that
possessed him than his<span class="pagenum"><a id="page222" name="page222"></a>Pg 222</span> own, and which he now evidently remembered with
a degree of remorse and pain which might well have entitled them to be
forgotten by others.</p>

<p>It was, at the same time, manifest, that, whatever admissions he might
be inclined to make respecting his own delinquencies, the inordinate
measure of the punishment dealt out to him had sunk deeply into his
mind, and, with the usual effect of such injustice, drove him also to be
unjust himself;&mdash;so much so, indeed, as to impute to the quarter, to
which he now traced all his ill fate, a feeling of fixed hostility to
himself, which would not rest, he thought, even at his grave, but
continue to persecute his memory as it was now embittering his life. So
strong was this impression upon him, that during one of our few
intervals of seriousness, he conjured me, by our friendship, if, as he
both felt and hoped, I should survive him, not to let unmerited censure
settle upon his name, but, while I surrendered him up to condemnation,
where he deserved it, to vindicate him where aspersed.</p>

<p>How groundless and wrongful were these apprehensions, the early death
which he so often predicted and sighed for has enabled us, unfortunately
but too soon, to testify. So far from having to defend him against any
such assailants, an unworthy voice or two, from persons more injurious
as friends than as enemies, is all that I find raised in hostility to
his name; while by none, I am inclined to think, would a generous
amnesty over his grave be more readily and cordially concurred in than
by her, among whose numerous virtues a forgiving charity towards
himself<span class="pagenum"><a id="page223" name="page223"></a>Pg 223</span> was the only one to which she had not yet taught him to render
justice.</p>

<p>I have already had occasion to remark, in another part of this work,
that with persons who, like Lord Byron, live centred in their own
tremulous web of sensitiveness, those friends of whom they see least,
and who, therefore, least frequently come in collision with them in
those every-day realities from which such natures shrink so morbidly,
have proportionately a greater chance of retaining a hold on their
affections. There is, however, in long absence from persons of this
temperament, another description of risk hardly less, perhaps, to be
dreaded. If the station a friend holds in their hearts is, in near
intercourse with them, in danger from their sensitiveness, it is almost
equally, perhaps, at the mercy of their too active imaginations during
absence. On this very point, I recollect once expressing my
apprehensions to Lord Byron, in a passage of a letter addressed to him
but a short time before his death, of which the following is, as nearly
as I can recall it, the substance:&mdash;"When <i>with</i> you, I feel <i>sure</i> of
you; but, at a distance, one is often a little afraid of being made the
victim, all of a sudden, of some of those fanciful suspicions, which,
like meteoric stones, generate themselves (God knows how) in the upper
regions of your imagination, and come clattering down upon our heads,
some fine sunny day, when we are least expecting such an invasion."</p>

<p>In writing thus to him, I had more particularly in recollection a fancy
of this kind respecting myself, which he had, not long before my present
visit to<span class="pagenum"><a id="page224" name="page224"></a>Pg 224</span> him at Venice, taken into his head. In a ludicrous, and now,
perhaps, forgotten publication of mine, giving an account of the
adventures of an English family in Paris, there had occurred the
following description of the chief hero of the tale:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"A fine, sallow, sublime sort of Werter-faced man,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With mustachios which gave (what we read of so oft)<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The dear Corsair expression, half savage, half soft,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As hy&aelig;nas in love may be fancied to look, or<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A something between Abelard and old Blucher."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>On seeing this doggrel, my noble friend,&mdash;as I might, indeed, with a
little more thought, have anticipated,&mdash;conceived the notion that I
meant to throw ridicule on his whole race of poetic heroes, and
accordingly, as I learned from persons then in frequent intercourse with
him, flew out into one of his fits of half humorous rage against me.
This he now confessed himself, and, in laughing over the circumstance
with me, owned that he had even gone so far as, in his first moments of
wrath, to contemplate some little retaliation for this perfidious hit at
his heroes. "But when I recollected," said he, "what pleasure it would
give the whole tribe of blockheads and blues to see you and me turning
out against each other, I gave up the idea." He was, indeed, a striking
instance of what may be almost invariably observed, that they who best
know how to wield the weapon of ridicule themselves, are the most alive
to its power in the hands of others. I remember, one day,&mdash;in the year
1813, I think,&mdash;as we were conversing together about critics and<span class="pagenum"><a id="page225" name="page225"></a>Pg 225</span> their
influence on the public. "For my part," he exclaimed, "I don't care what
they say of me, so they don't quiz me."&mdash;"Oh, you need not fear
that,"&mdash;I answered, with something, perhaps, of a half suppressed smile
on my features,&mdash;"nobody could quiz <i>you</i>"&mdash;"<i>You could</i>, you villain!"
he replied, clenching his hand at me, and looking, at the same time,
with comic earnestness into my face.</p>

<p>Before I proceed any farther with my own recollections, I shall here
take the opportunity of extracting some curious particulars respecting
the habits and mode of life of my friend while at Venice, from an
account obligingly furnished me by a gentleman who long resided in that
city, and who, during the greater part of Lord Byron's stay, lived on
terms of the most friendly intimacy with him.</p>

<p>"I have often lamented that I kept no notes of his observations during
our rides and aquatic excursions. Nothing could exceed the vivacity and
variety of his conversation, or the cheerfulness of his manner. His
remarks on the surrounding objects were always original: and most
particularly striking was the quickness with which he availed himself of
every circumstance, however trifling in itself, and such as would have
escaped the notice of almost any other person, to carry his point in
such arguments as we might chance to be engaged in. He was feelingly
alive to the beauties of nature, and took great interest in any
observations, which, as a dabbler in the arts, I ventured to make upon
the effects of light and shadow, or the changes pro<span class="pagenum"><a id="page226" name="page226"></a>Pg 226</span>duced in the colour
of objects by every variation in the atmosphere.</p>

<p>"The spot where we usually mounted our horses had been a Jewish
cemetery; but the French, during their occupation of Venice, had thrown
down the enclosures, and levelled all the tombstones with the ground, in
order that they might not interfere with the fortifications upon the
Lido, under the guns of which it was situated. To this place, as it was
known to be that where he alighted from his gondola and met his horses,
the curious amongst our country people, who were anxious to obtain a
glimpse of him, used to resort; and it was amusing in the extreme to
witness the excessive coolness with which ladies, as well as gentlemen,
would advance within a very few paces of him, eyeing him, some with
their glasses, as they would have done a statue in a museum, or the wild
beasts at Exeter 'Change. However flattering this might be to a man's
vanity, Lord Byron, though he bore it very patiently, expressed himself,
as I believe he really was, excessively annoyed at it.</p>

<p>"I have said that our usual ride was along the sea-shore, and that the
spot where we took horse, and of course dismounted, had been a cemetery.
It will readily be believed, that some caution was necessary in riding
over the broken tombstones, and that it was altogether an awkward place
for horses to pass. As the length of our ride was not very great,
scarcely more than six miles in all, we seldom rode fast, that we might
at least prolong its duration; and enjoy as much as possible the
refreshing<span class="pagenum"><a id="page227" name="page227"></a>Pg 227</span> air of the Adriatic. One day, as we were leisurely returning
homewards, Lord Byron, all at once, and without saying any thing to me,
set spurs to his horse and started off at full gallop, making the
greatest haste he could to get to his gondola. I could not conceive what
fit had seized him, and had some difficulty in keeping even within a
reasonable distance of him, while I looked around me to discover, if I
were able, what could be the cause of his unusual precipitation. At
length I perceived at some distance two or three gentlemen, who were
running along the opposite side of the island nearest the Lagoon,
parallel with him, towards his gondola, hoping to get there in time to
see him alight; and a race actually took place between them, he
endeavouring to outstrip them. In this he, in fact, succeeded, and,
throwing himself quickly from his horse, leapt into his gondola, of
which he hastily closed the blinds, ensconcing himself in a corner so as
not to be seen. For my own part, not choosing to risk my neck over the
ground I have spoken of, I followed more leisurely as soon as I came
amongst the gravestones, but got to the place of embarkation just at the
same moment with my curious countrymen, and in time to witness their
disappointment at having had their run for nothing. I found him exulting
in his success in outstripping them. He expressed in strong terms his
annoyance at what he called their impertinence, whilst I could not but
laugh at his impatience, as well as at the mortification of the
unfortunate pedestrians, whose eagerness to see him, I said, was, in my
opinion, highly<span class="pagenum"><a id="page228" name="page228"></a>Pg 228</span> flattering to him. That, he replied, depended on the
feeling with which they came; and he had not the vanity to believe that
they were influenced by any admiration of his character or of his
abilities, but that they were impelled merely by idle curiosity. Whether
it was so or not, I cannot help thinking that if they had been of the
other sex, he would not have been so eager to escape from their
observation, as in that case he would have repaid them glance for
glance.</p>

<p>"The curiosity that was expressed by all classes of travellers to see
him, and the eagerness with which they endeavoured to pick up any
anecdotes of his mode of life, were carried to a length which will
hardly be credited. It formed the chief subject of their enquiries of
the gondoliers who conveyed them from terra firma to the floating city;
and these people, who are generally loquacious, were not at all backward
in administering to the taste and humours of their passengers, relating
to them the most extravagant and often unfounded stories. They took care
to point out the house where he lived, and to give such hints of his
movements as might afford them an opportunity of seeing him. Many of the
English visiters, under pretext of seeing his house, in which there were
no paintings of any consequence, nor, besides himself, any thing worthy
of notice, contrived to obtain admittance through the cupidity of his
servants, and with the most barefaced impudence forced their way even
into his bedroom, in the hopes of seeing him. Hence arose, in a great
measure, his<span class="pagenum"><a id="page229" name="page229"></a>Pg 229</span> bitterness towards them, which he has expressed in a note
to one of his poems, on the occasion of some unfounded remark made upon
him by an anonymous traveller in Italy; and it certainly appears well
calculated to foster that cynicism which prevails in his latter works
more particularly, and which, as well as the misanthropical expressions
that occur in those which first raised his reputation, I do not believe
to have been his natural feeling. Of this I am certain, that I never
witnessed greater kindness than in Lord Byron.</p>

<p>"The inmates of his family were all extremely attached to him, and would
have endured any thing on his account. He was indeed culpably lenient to
them; for even when instances occurred of their neglecting their duty,
or taking an undue advantage of his good-nature, he rather bantered than
spoke seriously to them upon it, and could not bring himself to
discharge them, even when he had threatened to do so. An instance
occurred within my knowledge of his unwillingness to act harshly towards
a tradesman whom he had materially assisted, not only by lending him
money, but by forwarding his interest in every way that he could.
Notwithstanding repeated acts of kindness on Lord Byron's part, this man
robbed and cheated him in the most barefaced manner; and when at length
Lord Byron was induced to sue him at law for the recovery of his money,
the only punishment he inflicted upon him, when sentence against him was
passed, was to put him in prison for one week, and then to let him out
again,<span class="pagenum"><a id="page230" name="page230"></a>Pg 230</span> although his debtor had subjected him to a considerable
additional expense, by dragging him into all the different courts of
appeal, and that he never at last recovered one halfpenny of the money
owed to him. Upon this subject he writes to me from Ravenna, 'If * * is
in (prison), let him out; if out, put him in for a week, merely for a
lesson, and give him a good lecture.'</p>

<p>"He was also ever ready to assist the distressed, and he was most
unostentatious in his charities: for besides considerable sums which he
gave away to applicants at his own house, he contributed largely by
weekly and monthly allowances to persons whom he had never seen, and
who, as the money reached them by other hands, did not even know who was
their benefactor. One or two instances might be adduced where his
charity certainly bore an appearance of ostentation; one particularly,
when he sent fifty louis d'or to a poor printer whose house had been
burnt to the ground, and all his property destroyed; but even this was
not unattended with advantage; for it in a manner compelled the Austrian
authorities to do something for the poor sufferer, which I have no
hesitation in saying they would not have done otherwise; and I attribute
it entirely to the publicity of his donation, that they allowed the man
the use of an unoccupied house belonging to the government until he
could rebuild his own, or re-establish his business elsewhere. Other
instances might be perhaps discovered where his liberalities proceeded
from selfish, and not very<span class="pagenum"><a id="page231" name="page231"></a>Pg 231</span> worthy motives<a name="FNanchor_50_50" id="FNanchor_50_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a>; but these are rare, and
it would be unjust in the extreme to assume them as proofs of his
character."</p>

<p>It has been already mentioned that, in writing to my noble friend to
announce my coming, I had expressed a hope that he would be able to go
on with me to Rome; and I had the gratification of finding, on my
arrival, that he was fully prepared to enter into this plan. On becoming
acquainted, however, with all the details of his present situation, I so
far sacrificed my own wishes and pleasure as to advise strongly that he
should remain at La Mira. In the first place, I saw reason to apprehend
that his leaving Madame Guiccioli at this crisis might be the means of
drawing upon him the suspicion of neglecting, if not actually deserting,
a young person who had just sacrificed so much to her devotion for him,
and whose position, at this moment, between the Count and Lord Byron, it
required all the generous prudence of the latter to shield from shame or
fall. There had just occurred too, as it appeared to me, a most
favourable opening for the retrieval of, at least, the imprudent part of
the transaction, by replacing the lady instantly under her husband's
protection, and thus enabling her still to retain that station in
society which, in such society, nothing but such imprudence could have
endangered.</p>

<p>This latter hope had been suggested by a letter he<span class="pagenum"><a id="page232" name="page232"></a>Pg 232</span> one day showed me,
(as we were dining together alone, at the well-known Pellegrino,) which
had that morning been received by the Contessa from her husband, and the
chief object of which was&mdash;<i>not</i> to express any censure of her conduct,
but to suggest that she should prevail upon her noble admirer to
transfer into his keeping a sum of 1000<i>l.</i>, which was then lying, if I
remember right, in the hands of Lord Byron's banker at Ravenna, but
which the worthy Count professed to think would be more advantageously
placed in his own. Security, the writer added, would be given, and five
per cent. interest allowed; as to accept of the sum on any other terms
he should hold to be an "avvilimento" to him. Though, as regarded the
lady herself, who has since proved, by a most noble sacrifice, how
perfectly disinterested were her feelings throughout<a name="FNanchor_51_51" id="FNanchor_51_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a>, this trait of
so wholly<span class="pagenum"><a id="page233" name="page233"></a>Pg 233</span> opposite a character in her lord must have still further
increased her disgust at returning to him, yet so important did it seem,
as well for her friend's sake as her own, to retrace, while there was
yet time, their last imprudent step, that even the sacrifice of this
sum, which I saw would materially facilitate such an arrangement, did
not appear to me by any means too high a price to pay for it. On this
point, however, my noble friend entirely differed with me; and nothing
could be more humorous and amusing than the manner in which, in his
newly assumed character of a lover of money, he dilated on the many
virtues of a thousand pounds, and his determination not to part with a
single one of them to Count Guiccioli. Of his confidence, too, in his
own power of extricating himself from this difficulty he spoke with
equal gaiety and humour; and Mr. Scott, who joined our party after
dinner, having taken the same view of the subject as I did, he laid a
wager of two sequins with that gentleman, that, without any such
disbursement, he would yet bring all right again, and "save the lady and
the money too."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page234" name="page234"></a>Pg 234</span></p>

<p>It is indeed, certain, that he had at this time taken up the whim (for
it hardly deserves a more serious name) of minute and constant
watchfulness over his expenditure; and, as most usually happens, it was
with the increase of his means that this increased sense of the value of
money came. The first symptom I saw of this new fancy of his was the
exceeding joy which he manifested on my presenting to him a rouleau of
twenty Napoleons, which Lord K * *d, to whom he had, on some occasion,
lent that sum, had intrusted me with, at Milan, to deliver into his
hands. With the most joyous and diverting eagerness, he tore open the
paper, and, in counting over the sum, stopped frequently to congratulate
himself on the recovery of it.</p>

<p>Of his household frugalities I speak but on the authority of others; but
it is not difficult to conceive that, with a restless spirit like his,
which delighted always in having something to contend with, and which,
but a short time before, "for want," as he said, "of something craggy to
break upon," had tortured itself with the study of the Armenian
language, he should, in default of all better excitement, find a sort of
stir and amusement in the task of contesting, inch by inch, every
encroachment of expense, and endeavouring to suppress what he himself
calls</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"That climax of all earthly ills,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The inflammation of our weekly bills."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>In truth, his constant recurrence to the praise of avarice in Don Juan,
and the humorous zest with<span class="pagenum"><a id="page235" name="page235"></a>Pg 235</span> which he delights to dwell on it, shows how
new-fangled, as well as how far from serious, was his adoption of this
"good old-gentlemanly vice." In the same spirit he had, a short time
before my arrival at Venice, established a hoarding-box, with a slit in
the lid, into which he occasionally put sequins, and, at stated periods,
opened it to contemplate his treasures. His own ascetic style of living
enabled him, as far as himself was concerned, to gratify this taste for
economy in no ordinary degree,&mdash;his daily bill of fare, when the
Margarita was his companion, consisting, I have been assured, of but
four beccafichi, of which the Fornarina eat three, leaving even him
hungry.</p>

<p>That his parsimony, however (if this new phasis of his ever-shifting
character is to be called by such a name), was very far from being of
that kind which Bacon condemns, as "withholding men from works of
liberality," is apparent from all that is known of his munificence, at
this very period,&mdash;some particulars of which, from a most authentic
source, have just been cited, proving amply that while, for the
indulgence of a whim, he kept one hand closed, he gave free course to
his generous nature by dispensing lavishly from the other. It should be
remembered, too, that as long as money shall continue to be one of the
great sources of power, so long will they who seek influence over their
fellow-men attach value to it as an instrument; and the more lowly they
are inclined to estimate the disinterestedness of the human heart, the
more available and precious will they consider the talisman that gives
such<span class="pagenum"><a id="page236" name="page236"></a>Pg 236</span> power over it. Hence, certainly, it is not among those who have
thought highest of mankind that the disposition to avarice has most
generally displayed itself. In Swift the love of money was strong and
avowed; and to Voltaire the same propensity was also frequently
imputed,&mdash;on about as sufficient grounds, perhaps, as to Lord Byron.</p>

<p>On the day preceding that of my departure from Venice, my noble host, on
arriving from La Mira to dinner, told me, with all the glee of a
schoolboy who had been just granted a holiday, that, as this was my last
evening, the Contessa had given him leave to "make a night of it," and
that accordingly he would not only accompany me to the opera, but we
should sup together at some cafe (as in the old times) afterwards.
Observing a volume in his gondola, with a number of paper marks between
the leaves, I enquired of him what it was?&mdash;"Only a book," he answered,
"from which I am trying to <i>crib</i>, as I do wherever I can<a name="FNanchor_52_52" id="FNanchor_52_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a>;&mdash;and
that's the way I get the character of an original poet." On taking it up
and looking into it, I exclaimed, "Ah, my old friend,
Agathon!"<a name="FNanchor_53_53" id="FNanchor_53_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a>&mdash;"What!" he cried, archly, "you have been beforehand with
me there, have you?"</p>

<p>Though in imputing to himself premeditated plagiarism, he was, of
course, but jesting, it was, I am inclined to think, his practice, when
engaged in the composition of any work, to excite thus his vein<span class="pagenum"><a id="page237" name="page237"></a>Pg 237</span> by the
perusal of others, on the same subject or plan, from which the slightest
hint caught by his imagination, as he read, was sufficient to kindle
there such a train of thought as, but for that spark, had never been
awakened, and of which he himself soon forgot the source. In the present
instance, the inspiration he sought was of no very elevating
nature,&mdash;the anti-spiritual doctrines of the Sophist in this Romance<a name="FNanchor_54_54" id="FNanchor_54_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a>
being what chiefly, I suspect, attracted his attention to its pages, as
not unlikely to supply him with fresh argument and sarcasm for those
depreciating views of human nature and its destiny,<span class="pagenum"><a id="page238" name="page238"></a>Pg 238</span> which he was now,
with all the wantonness of unbounded genius, enforcing in Don Juan.</p>

<p>Of this work he was, at the time of my visit to him, writing the third
Canto, and before dinner, one day, read me two or three hundred lines of
it;&mdash;beginning with the stanzas "Oh Wellington," &amp;c. which at that time
formed the opening of this third Canto, but were afterwards reserved for
the commencement of the ninth. My opinion of the poem, both as regarded
its talent and its mischief, he had already been made acquainted with,
from my having been one of those,&mdash;his Committee, as he called us,&mdash;to
whom, at his own desire, the manuscript of the two first Cantos had been
submitted, and who, as the reader has seen, angered him not a little by
deprecating the publication of it. In a letter which I, at that time,
wrote to him on the subject, after praising the exquisite beauty of the
scenes between Juan and Haid&eacute;e, I ventured to say, "Is it not odd that
the same licence which, in your early Satire, you blamed <i>me</i> for being
guilty of on the borders of my twentieth year, you are now yourself
(with infinitely greater power, and therefore infinitely greater
mischief) indulging in <i>after</i> thirty!"</p>

<p>Though I now found him, in full defiance of such remonstrances,
proceeding with this work, he had yet, as his own letters prove, been so
far influenced by the general outcry against his poem, as to feel the
zeal and zest with which he had commenced it considerably abated,&mdash;so
much so, as to render, ultimately, in his own opinion, the third and
fourth Cantos much inferior in spirit to the two first. So<span class="pagenum"><a id="page239" name="page239"></a>Pg 239</span> sensitive,
indeed,&mdash;in addition to his usual abundance of this quality,&mdash;did he, at
length, grow on the subject, that when Mr. W. Bankes, who succeeded me,
as his visiter, happened to tell him, one day, that he had heard a Mr.
Saunders (or some such name), then resident at Venice, declare that, in
his opinion, "Don Juan was all Grub Street," such an effect had this
disparaging speech upon his mind, (though coming from a person who, as
he himself would have it, was "nothing but a d&mdash;&mdash;d salt-fish seller,")
that, for some time after, by his own confession to Mr. Bankes, he could
not bring himself to write another line of the poem; and, one morning,
opening a drawer where the neglected manuscript lay, he said to his
friend, "Look here&mdash;this is all Mr. Saunders's 'Grub Street.'"</p>

<p>To return, however, to the details of our last evening together at
Venice. After a dinner with Mr. Scott at the Pellegrino, we all went,
rather late, to the opera, where the principal part in the Baccanali di
Roma was represented by a female singer, whose chief claim to
reputation, according to Lord Byron, lay in her having <i>stilettoed</i> one
of her favourite lovers. In the intervals between the singing he pointed
out to me different persons among the audience, to whom celebrity of
various sorts, but, for the most part, disreputable, attached; and of
one lady who sat near us, he related an anecdote, which, whether new or
old, may, as creditable to Venetian facetiousness, be worth, perhaps,
repeating. This lady had, it seems, been pronounced by Napoleon the
finest woman in Venice; but the Venetians,<span class="pagenum"><a id="page240" name="page240"></a>Pg 240</span> not quite agreeing with this
opinion of the great man, contented themselves with calling her "La
Bella <i>per Decr&eacute;to</i>,"&mdash;adding (as the Decrees always begin with the word
"Considerando"), "Ma <i>senza</i> il Considerando."</p>

<p>From the opera, in pursuance of our agreement to "make a night of it,"
we betook ourselves to a sort of <i>cabaret</i> in the Place of St. Mark, and
there, within a few yards of the Palace of the Doges, sat drinking hot
brandy punch, and laughing over old times, till the clock of St. Mark
struck the second hour of the morning. Lord Byron then took me in his
gondola, and, the moon being in its fullest splendour, he made the
gondoliers row us to such points of view as might enable me to see
Venice, at that hour, to advantage. Nothing could be more solemnly
beautiful than the whole scene around, and I had, for the first time,
the Venice of my dreams before me. All those meaner details which so
offend the eye by day were now softened down by the moonlight into a
sort of visionary indistinctness; and the effect of that silent city of
palaces, sleeping, as it were, upon the waters, in the bright stillness
of the night, was such as could not but affect deeply even the least
susceptible imagination. My companion saw that I was moved by it, and
though familiar with the scene himself, seemed to give way, for the
moment, to the same strain of feeling; and, as we exchanged a few
remarks suggested by that wreck of human glory before us, his voice,
habitually so cheerful, sunk into a tone of mournful sweetness, such as
I had rarely before heard from him, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="page241" name="page241"></a>Pg 241</span> shall not easily forget. This
mood, however, was but of the moment; some quick turn of ridicule soon
carried him off into a totally different vein, and at about three
o'clock in the morning, at the door of his own palazzo, we parted,
laughing, as we had met;&mdash;an agreement having been first made that I
should take an early dinner with him next day at his villa, on my road
to Ferrara.</p>

<p>Having employed the morning of the following day in completing my round
of sights at Venice,&mdash;taking care to visit specially "that picture by
Giorgione," to which the poet's exclamation, "<i>such</i> a woman!"<a name="FNanchor_55_55" id="FNanchor_55_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a> will
long continue to attract all votaries of beauty,&mdash;I took my departure
from Venice, and, at about three o'clock, arrived at La Mira. I found my
noble host waiting to receive me, and, in passing with him through the
hall, saw his little Allegra, who, with her nursery maid, was standing
there as if just returned from a walk. To the perverse fancy he had for
falsifying his own character, and even imputing to himself faults the
most alien to his nature, I have already frequently adverted, and had,
on this occasion, a striking instance of it. After I had spoken a
little, in passing, to the child, and made some remark on its beauty, he
said to me,&mdash;<span class="pagenum"><a id="page242" name="page242"></a>Pg 242</span>"Have you any notion&mdash;but I suppose <i>you</i> have&mdash;of what
they call the parental feeling? For myself, I have not the least." And
yet, when that child died, in a year or two afterwards, he who now
uttered this artificial speech was so overwhelmed by the event, that
those who were about him at the time actually trembled for his reason!</p>

<p>A short time before dinner he left the room, and in a minute or two
returned, carrying in his hand a white leather bag. "Look here," he
said, holding it up&mdash;"this would be worth something to Murray, though
<i>you</i>, I dare say, would not give sixpence for it."&mdash;"What is it?" I
asked.&mdash;"My Life and Adventures," he answered. On hearing this, I raised
my hands in a gesture of wonder. "It is not a thing," he continued,
"that can be published during my lifetime, but you may have it&mdash;if you
like&mdash;there, do whatever you please with it." In taking the bag, and
thanking him most warmly, I added, "This will make a nice legacy for my
little Tom, who shall astonish the latter days of the nineteenth century
with it." He then added, "You may show it to any of our friends you
think worthy of it:"&mdash;and this is, nearly word for word, the whole of
what passed between us on the subject.</p>

<p>At dinner we were favoured with the presence of Madame Guiccioli, who
was so obliging as to furnish me, at Lord Byron's suggestion, with a
letter of introduction to her brother, Count Gamba, whom it was
probable, they both thought, I should meet at Rome. This letter I never
had an opportunity of presenting; and as it was left open for me to
read,<span class="pagenum"><a id="page243" name="page243"></a>Pg 243</span> and was, the greater part of it, I have little doubt, dictated by
my noble friend, I may venture, without impropriety, to give an extract
from it here;&mdash;premising that the allusion to the "Castle," &amp;c. refers
to some tales respecting the cruelty of Lord Byron to his wife, which
the young Count had heard, and, at this time, implicitly believed. After
a few sentences of compliment to the bearer, the letter proceeds:&mdash;"He
is on his way to see the wonders of Rome, and there is no one, I am
sure, more qualified to enjoy them. I shall be gratified and obliged by
your acting, as far as you can, as his guide. He is a friend of Lord
Byron's, and much more accurately acquainted with his history than those
who have related it to you. He will accordingly describe to you, if you
ask him, <i>the shape, the dimensions</i>, and whatever else you may please
to require, of <i>that Castle in which he keeps imprisoned a young and
innocent wife</i>, &amp;c. &amp;c. My dear Pietro, whenever you feel inclined to
laugh, do send two lines of answer to your sister, who loves and ever
will love you with the greatest tenderness.&mdash;Teresa Guiccioli."<a name="FNanchor_56_56" id="FNanchor_56_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a></p><p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page244" name="page244"></a>Pg 244</span></p>

<p>After expressing his regret that I had not been able to prolong my stay
at Venice, my noble friend said, "At least, I think, you might spare a
day or two to go with me to Arqu&agrave;. I should like," he continued,
thoughtfully, "to visit that tomb with you:"&mdash;then, breaking off into
his usual gay tone; "a pair of poetical pilgrims&mdash;eh, Tom, what say
you?"&mdash;That I should have declined this offer, and thus lost the
opportunity of an excursion which would have been remembered, as a
bright dream, through all my after-life, is a circumstance I never can
think of without wonder and self-reproach. But the main design on which
I had then set my mind of reaching Rome, and, if possible, Naples,
within the limited period which circumstances allowed, rendered me far
less alive than I ought to have been to the preciousness of the episode
thus offered to me.</p>

<p>When it was time for me to depart, he expressed his intention to
accompany me a few miles; and, ordering his horses to follow, proceeded
with me in the carriage as far as Str&agrave;, where for the last time&mdash;how
little thinking it was to be the last!&mdash;I bade my kind and admirable
friend farewell.</p>

your troubles by requesting you to be judge between Mr. E * * * and
myself in a small matter of imputed peculation and irregular
accounts on the part of that phoenix of secretaries. As I knew that
you had not parted friends, at the same time that <i>I</i> refused for
my own part any judgment but <i>yours</i>, I offered him his choice of
any person, the <i>least</i> scoundrel native to be found in Venice, as
his own umpire; but he expressed himself so convinced of your
impartiality, that he declined any but <i>you</i>. This is in his
favour.&mdash;The paper within will explain to you the default in his
accounts. You will hear his explanation, and decide if it so please
you. I shall not appeal from the decision.</p>

<p>"As he complained that his salary was insufficient, I determined to
have his accounts examined, and the enclosed was the result.&mdash;It is
all in black and white with documents, and I have despatched
Fletcher to explain (or rather to perplex) the matter.</p>

<p>"I have had much civility and kindness from Mr. Dorville during
your journey, and I thank him accordingly.</p>

<p>"Your letter reached me at your departure<a name="FNanchor_57_57" id="FNanchor_57_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a>, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="page246" name="page246"></a>Pg 246</span> displeased me
very much:&mdash;not that it might not be true in its statement and kind
in its intention, but you have lived long enough to know how
useless all such representations ever are and must be in cases
where the passions are concerned. To reason with men in such a
situation is like reasoning with a drunkard in his cups&mdash;the only
answer you will get from him is, that he is sober, and you are
drunk.</p>

<p>"Upon that subject we will (if you like) be silent. You might only
say what would distress me without answering any purpose whatever;
and I have too many obligations to you to answer you in the same
style. So that you should recollect that you have also that
advantage over me. I hope to see you soon.</p>

<p>"I suppose you know that they said at Venice, that I was arrested
at Bologna as a <i>Carbonaro</i>&mdash;story about as true as their usual
conversation. Moore has been here&mdash;I lodged him in my house at
Venice, and went to see him daily; but I could not at that time
quit La Mira entirely. You and I were not very far from meeting in
Switzerland. With my best respects to Mrs. Hoppner, believe me ever
and truly, &amp;c.</p>

<p>"P.S. Allegra is here in good health and spirits&mdash;I shall keep her
with me till I go to England, which will perhaps be in the spring.
It<span class="pagenum"><a id="page247" name="page247"></a>Pg 247</span> has just occurred to me that you may not perhaps like to
undertake the office of judge between Mr. E. and your humble
servant.&mdash;Of course, as Mr. Liston (the comedian, not the
ambassador) says, '<i>it is all hoptional</i>;' but I have no other
resource. I do not wish to find him a rascal, if it can be avoided,
and would rather think him guilty of carelessness than cheating.
The case is this&mdash;can I, or not, give him a character for
<i>honesty</i>?&mdash;It is not my intention to continue him in my service."</p></div>

<p>"You need not have made any excuses about the letter: I never said
but that you might, could, should, or would have reason. I merely
described my own state of inaptitude to listen to it at that time,
and in those circumstances. Besides, you did not speak from your
<i>own</i> authority&mdash;but from what you said you had heard. Now my blood
boils to hear an Italian speaking ill of another Italian, because,
though they lie in particular, they speak truth in general by
speaking ill at all;&mdash;and although they know that they are trying
and wishing to lie, they do not succeed, merely because they can
say nothing so bad of each other, that it <i>may</i> not, and must not

<p>"With regard to E., you will perceive a most irregular, extravagant
account, without proper documents to support it. He demanded an
increase of salary, which made me suspect him; he supported an
outrageous extravagance of expenditure, and did not like the
dismission of the cook; he never complained of him&mdash;as in duty
bound&mdash;at the time of his robberies. I can only say, that the house
expense is now under <i>one half</i> of what it then was, as he himself
admits. He charged for a comb <i>eighteen</i> francs,&mdash;the real price
was <i>eight</i>. He charged a passage from Fusina for a person named
Iambelli, who paid it <i>herself</i>, as she will prove if necessary. He
fancies, or asserts himself, the victim of a domestic complot
against him;&mdash;accounts are accounts&mdash;prices are prices;&mdash;let him
make out a fair detail. <i>I</i> am not prejudiced against him&mdash;on the
contrary, I supported him against the complaints of his wife, and
of his former master, at a time when I could have crushed him like
an earwig; and if he is a scoundrel, he is the<span class="pagenum"><a id="page249" name="page249"></a>Pg 249</span> greatest of
scoundrels, an ungrateful one. The truth is, probably, that he
thought I was leaving Venice, and determined to make the most of
it. At present he keeps bringing in <i>account after account</i>, though
he had always money in hand&mdash;as I believe you know my system was
never to allow longer than a week's bills to run. Pray read him
this letter&mdash;I desire nothing to be concealed against which he may
defend himself.</p>

sore subject with the moral reader, and has been the cause of a
great row; but I am glad you like it. I will say nothing about the

technical as verse could admit in the octave measure.</p>

<p>"The poem has <i>not sold well</i>, so Murray says&mdash;'but the best

from me, at Bologna, two months ago. Pray tell me, was this letter
received and forwarded?</p>

<p>"You say nothing of the vice-consulate for the Ravenna patrician,
from which it is to be inferred that the thing will not be done.</p>

<p>"I had written about a hundred stanzas of a <i>third</i> Canto to Don
Juan, but the reception of the two first is no encouragement to you
nor me to proceed.</p>

<p>"I had also written about 600 lines of a poem, the Vision (or
Prophecy) of Dante, the subject a view of Italy in the ages down to
the present&mdash;supposing Dante to speak in his own person, previous
to his death, and embracing all topics in the way of prophecy, like
Lycophron's Cassandra; but this and the other are both at a
stand-still for the present.</p>

<p>"I gave Moore, who is gone to Rome, my Life in MS., in
seventy-eight folio sheets, brought down to 1816. But this I put
into his hands for <i>his</i> care, as he has some other MSS. of mine&mdash;a
Journal kept in 1814, &amp;c. Neither are for publication during my
life; but when I am cold you may do what you please. In the mean
time, if you like to read them you may, and show them to anybody
you like&mdash;I care not.</p>

<p>"The Life is <i>Memoranda</i>, and not <i>Confessions</i> I have left out all
my <i>loves</i> (except in a general way), and many other of the most
important things (because I must not compromise other people), so
that it is like the play of Hamlet&mdash;'the part of Hamlet omitted by
particular desire.' But you will<span class="pagenum"><a id="page252" name="page252"></a>Pg 252</span> find many opinions, and some fun,
with a detailed account of my marriage, and its consequences, as
true as a party concerned can make such account, for I suppose we
are all prejudiced.</p>

<p>"I have never read over this Life since it was written, so that I
know not exactly what it may repeat or contain. Moore and I passed
some merry days together.</p>

<p>"I probably must return for business, or in my way to America.
Pray, did you get a letter for Hobhouse, who will have told you the
contents? I understand that the Venezuelan commissioners had orders
to treat with emigrants; now I want to go there. I should not make
a bad South-American planter, and I should take my natural
daughter, Allegra, with me, and settle. I wrote, at length, to
Hobhouse, to get information from Perry, who, I suppose, is the

<p>"I have been ill these eight days with a tertian fever, caught in
the country on horseback in a thunderstorm. Yesterday I had the
fourth attack:<span class="pagenum"><a id="page256" name="page256"></a>Pg 256</span> the two last were very smart, the first day as well
as the last being preceded by vomiting. It is the fever of the
place and the season. I feel weakened, but not unwell, in the
intervals, except headach and lassitude.</p>

<p>"Count Guiccioli has arrived in Venice, and has presented his
spouse (who had preceded him two months for her health and the
prescriptions of Dr. Aglietti) with a paper of conditions,
regulations of hours and conduct, and morals, &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c. which he
insists on her accepting, and she persists in refusing. I am
expressly, it should seem, excluded by this treaty, as an
indispensable preliminary; so that they are in high dissension, and
what the result may be I know not, particularly as they are
consulting friends.</p>

<p>"To-night, as Countess Guiccioli observed me poring over 'Don
Juan,' she stumbled by mere chance on the 137th stanza of the first
Canto, and asked me what it meant. I told her, 'Nothing&mdash;but "your
husband is coming."' As I said this in Italian, with some emphasis,
she started up in a fright, and said, '<i>Oh, my God, is</i> he
<i>coming</i>?' thinking it was <i>her own</i>, who either was or ought to
have been at the theatre. You may suppose we laughed when she found
out the mistake. You will be amused, as I was;&mdash;it happened not
three hours ago.</p>

<p>"I wrote to you last week, but have added nothing to the third
Canto since my fever, nor to 'The Prophecy of Dante.' Of the former
there are about 100 octaves done; of the latter about 500<span class="pagenum"><a id="page257" name="page257"></a>Pg 257</span>
lines&mdash;perhaps more. Moore saw the third Juan, as far as it then
went. I do not know if my fever will let me go on with either, and
the tertian lasts, they say, a good while. I had it in Malta on my
way home, and the malaria fever in Greece the year before that. The
Venetian is not very fierce, but I was delirious one of the nights
with it, for an hour or two, and, on my senses coming back, found
Fletcher sobbing on one side of the bed, and La Contessa
Guiccioli<a name="FNanchor_60_60" id="FNanchor_60_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_60_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a> weeping on the other; so that<span class="pagenum"><a id="page258" name="page258"></a>Pg 258</span> I had no want of
attendance. I have not yet taken any physician, because, though I
think they may relieve in chronic disorders, such as gout and the
like, &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c. (though they can't cure them)&mdash;just as surgeons
are necessary to set bones and tend wounds&mdash;yet I think fevers
quite out of their reach, and remediable only by diet and nature.</p>

is answering his book. William Bankes is in quarantine at Trieste.
I have not lately heard from you. Excuse this paper: it is long
paper shortened for the occasion. What folly is this of Carlile's
trial? why let him have the honours of a martyr? it will only
advertise the books in question. Yours, &amp;c.</p>

<p>"P.S. As I tell you that the Guiccioli business is on the eve of
exploding in one way or the other, I will just add that, without
attempting to influence the decision of the Contessa, a good deal
depends upon it. If she and her husband make it up, you will,
perhaps, see me in England sooner than you expect. If not, I shall
retire with her to France or America, change my name, and lead a
quiet provincial life. All this may seem odd, but I have got the

nor her connections by<span class="pagenum"><a id="page259" name="page259"></a>Pg 259</span> birth or marriage are inferior to my own, I
am in honour bound to support her through. Besides, she is a very

<p>The struggle which, at the time of my visit to him, I had found Lord
Byron so well disposed to make towards averting, as far as now lay in
his power, some of the mischievous consequences which, both to the
object of his attachment and himself, were likely to result from their
connection, had been brought, as the foregoing letters show, to a crisis
soon after I left him. The Count Guiccioli, on his arrival at Venice,
insisted, as we have seen, that his lady should return with him; and,
after some conjugal negotiations, in which Lord Byron does not appear to
have interfered, the young Contessa consented reluctantly to accompany
her lord to Ravenna,<span class="pagenum"><a id="page263" name="page263"></a>Pg 263</span> it being first covenanted that, in future, all
communication between her and her lover should cease.</p>

<p>"In a few days after this," says Mr. Hoppner, in some notices of his
noble friend with which he has favoured me, "he returned to Venice, very
much out of spirits, owing to Madame Guiccioli's departure, and out of
humour with every body and every thing around him. We resumed our rides
at the Lido; and I did my best not only to raise his spirits, but to
make him forget his absent mistress, and to keep him to his purpose of
returning to England. He went into no society; and having no longer any
relish for his former occupation, his time, when he was not writing,
hung heavy enough on hand."</p>

<p>The promise given by the lovers not to correspond was, as all parties
must have foreseen, soon violated; and the letters Lord Byron addressed
to the lady, at this time, though written in a language not his own, are
rendered frequently even eloquent by the mere force of the feeling that
governed him&mdash;a feeling which could not have owed its fuel to fancy
alone, since now that reality had been so long substituted, it still
burned on. From one of these letters, dated November 25th, I shall so
far presume upon the discretionary power vested in me, as to lay a short
extract or two before the reader&mdash;not merely as matters of curiosity,
but on account of the strong evidence they afford of the struggle
between passion and a sense of right that now agitated him.</p>

<p>"You are," he says, "and ever will be, my first thought. But, at this
moment, I am in a state most<span class="pagenum"><a id="page264" name="page264"></a>Pg 264</span> dreadful, not knowing which way to
decide;&mdash;on the one hand, fearing that I should compromise you for ever,
by my return to Ravenna and the consequences of such a step, and, on the
other, dreading that I shall lose both you and myself, and all that I
have ever known or tasted of happiness, by never seeing you more. I pray
of you, I implore you to be comforted, and to believe that I cannot
cease to love you but with my life."<a name="FNanchor_61_61" id="FNanchor_61_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_61_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a> In another part he says, "I go
to save you, and leave a country insupportable to me without you. Your
letters to F * * and myself do wrong to my motives&mdash;but you will yet see
your injustice. It is not enough that I must leave you&mdash;from motives of
which ere long you will be convinced&mdash;it is not enough that I must fly
from Italy, with a heart deeply wounded, after having passed all my days
in solitude since your departure, sick both in body and mind&mdash;but I must
also have to endure your reproaches without answering and without
deserving them. Farewell! in that one word is comprised the death of my
happiness."<a name="FNanchor_62_62" id="FNanchor_62_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a></p><p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page265" name="page265"></a>Pg 265</span></p>

<p>He had now arranged every thing for his departure for England, and had
even fixed the day, when accounts reached him from Ravenna that the
Contessa was alarmingly ill;&mdash;her sorrow at their separation having so
much preyed upon her mind, that even her own family, fearful of the
consequences, had withdrawn all opposition to her wishes, and now, with
the sanction of Count Guiccioli himself, entreated her lover to hasten
to Ravenna. What was he, in this dilemma, to do? Already had he
announced his coming to different friends in England, and every dictate,
he felt, of prudence and manly fortitude urged his departure. While thus
balancing between duty and inclination, the day appointed for his
setting out arrived; and the following picture, from the life, of his
irresolution on the occasion, is from a letter written by a female
friend of Madame Guiccioli, who was present at the scene:&mdash;"He was ready
dressed for the journey, his gloves and cap on, and even his little cane
in his hand. Nothing was<span class="pagenum"><a id="page266" name="page266"></a>Pg 266</span> now waited for but his coming down
stairs,&mdash;his boxes being already all on board the gondola. At this
moment, my Lord, by way of pretext, declares, that if it should strike
one o'clock before every thing was in order (his arms being the only
thing not yet quite ready), he would not go that day. The hour strikes,
and he remains!"<a name="FNanchor_63_63" id="FNanchor_63_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_63_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a></p>

<p>The writer adds, "it is evident he has not the heart to go;" and the
result proved that she had not judged him wrongly. The very next day's
tidings from Ravenna decided his fate, and he himself, in a letter to
the Contessa, thus announces the triumph which she had achieved. "F * *
* will already have told you, <i>with her accustomed sublimity</i>, that Love
has gained the victory. I could not summon up resolution enough to leave
the country where you are, without, at least, once more seeing you. On
<i>yourself</i>, perhaps, it will depend, whether I ever again shall leave
you. Of the rest we shall speak when we meet. You ought, by this time,
to know which is most conducive to your welfare, my presence or my
absence. For myself, I am a citizen of the world&mdash;all countries are
alike to me. You have ever been, since our first acquaintance, <i>the sole
object of my thoughts</i>.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page267" name="page267"></a>Pg 267</span> My opinion was, that the best course I could
adopt, both for your peace and that of all your family, would have been
to depart and go far, <i>far</i> away from you;&mdash;since to have been near and
not approach you would have been, for me, impossible. You have however
decided that I am to return to Ravenna. I shall accordingly return&mdash;and
shall <i>do</i>&mdash;and <i>be</i> all that you wish. I cannot say more.<a name="FNanchor_64_64" id="FNanchor_64_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_64_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a></p>

<p>On quitting Venice he took leave of Mr. Hoppner in a short but cordial
letter, which I cannot better introduce than by prefixing to it the few
words of comment with which this excellent friend of the noble poet has
himself accompanied it:&mdash;"I need not say with what painful feeling I
witnessed the departure of a person who, from the first day of our
acquaintance, had treated me with unvaried kindness, reposing a
confidence in me which it was beyond the power of my utmost efforts to
deserve; admitting me to an intimacy which I had no right<span class="pagenum"><a id="page268" name="page268"></a>Pg 268</span> to claim, and
listening with patience, and the greatest good temper, to the
remonstrances I ventured to make upon his conduct."</p>

on a second with you. Pray make my respects to Mrs. Hoppner, and
assure her of my unalterable reverence for the singular goodness of

nobler models. Make, too, what excuses you can for my omission of

<p><b>LETTER 350. TO MR. MURRAY.</b></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Venice, December 10. 1819.</p>

<p>"Since I last wrote, I have changed my mind, and shall not come to
England. The more I contemplate, the more I dislike the place and
the prospect. You may, therefore, address to me as usual <i>here</i>,
though I mean to go to another city. I have<span class="pagenum"><a id="page269" name="page269"></a>Pg 269</span> finished the third
Canto of Don Juan, but the things I have read and heard discourage
all further publication&mdash;at least for the present. You may try the
copy question, but you'll lose it: the cry is up, and cant is up. I
should have no objection to return the price of the copyright, and
have written to Mr. Kinnaird by this post on the subject. Talk with
him.</p>

<p>"I have not the patience, nor do I feel interest enough in the
question, to contend with the fellows in their own slang; but I
perceive Mr. Blackwood's Magazine and one or two others of your
missives have been hyperbolical in their praise, and diabolical in
their abuse. I like and admire W * *n, and <i>he</i> should not have
indulged himself in such outrageous licence.<a name="FNanchor_65_65" id="FNanchor_65_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_65_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a> It is overdone and
defeats itself. What would he say to the grossness without passion
and the misanthropy without feeling of Gulliver's Travels?&mdash;When he
talks of Lady's Byron's business, he talks of what he knows nothing
about; and you may tell him that no one can more desire a public
investigation of that affair than I do.</p>

<p>"I sent home by Moore (<i>for</i> Moore only, who has my Journal also)
my Memoir written up to 1816, and I gave him leave to show it to
whom he pleased,<span class="pagenum"><a id="page270" name="page270"></a>Pg 270</span> but <i>not to publish</i>, on any account. You may
read it, and you may let W * *n read it, if he likes&mdash;not for his
<i>public</i> opinion, but his private; for I like the man, and care
very little about his Magazine. And I could wish Lady B. herself to
read it, that she may have it in her power to mark any thing
mistaken or mis-stated; as it may probably appear after my
extinction, and it would be but fair she should see it,&mdash;that is to
say, herself willing.</p>

<p>"Perhaps I may take a journey to you in the spring; but I <i>have</i>
been ill and <i>am</i> indolent and indecisive, because few things
interest me. These fellows first abused me for being gloomy, and
now they are wroth that I am, or attempted to be, facetious. I have
got such a cold and headach that I can hardly see what I
scrawl:&mdash;the winters here are as sharp as needles. Some time ago, I
wrote to you rather fully about my Italian affairs; at present I
can say no more except that you shall hear further by and by.</p>

<p>"Your Blackwood accuses me of treating women harshly: it may be so,
but I have been their martyr; my whole life has been sacrificed
<i>to</i> them and <i>by</i> them. I mean to leave Venice in a few days, but
you will address your letters <i>here</i> as usual. When I fix
elsewhere, you shall know."</p></div>

<p>Soon after this letter to Mr. Murray he set out for Ravenna, from which
place we shall find his correspondence for the next year and a half
dated. For a short time after his arrival, he took up his residence at
an inn; but the Count Guiccioli having allowed<span class="pagenum"><a id="page271" name="page271"></a>Pg 271</span> him to hire a suite of
apartments in the Palazzo Guiccioli itself, he was once more lodged
under the same roof with the Countess Guiccioli.</p>

not, at first, go back with him&mdash;at least, she <i>did</i> go back with
him; but he insisted, reasonably enough, that all communication
should be broken off between her and me. So, finding Italy very
dull, and having a fever tertian, I packed up my valise, and
prepared to cross the Alps; but my daughter fell ill, and detained
me.</p>

<p>"After her arrival at Ravenna, the Guiccioli fell ill again too;
and at last, her father (who had, all along, opposed the liaison

husband had acquiesced, in consequence of her relapse, and that
<i>he</i> (her father) would guarantee all this, and that there would be
no farther scenes in consequence between them, and that I should
not be compromised in any way. I set out soon after, and have been

<p>"I have not decided any thing about remaining at Ravenna. I may
stay a day, a week, a year, all my life; but all this depends upon
what I can neither see nor foresee. I came because I was called,
and will go the moment that I perceive what may render my departure
proper. My attachment has neither the blindness of the beginning,
nor the microscopic accuracy of the close to such liaisons; but
'time and the hour' must decide upon what I do. I can as yet say
nothing, because I hardly know any thing beyond what I have told
you.</p>

<p>"I wrote to you last post for my movables, as there is no getting a
lodging with a chair or table here ready; and as I have already
some things of the sort at Bologna which I had last summer there
for my daughter, I have directed them to be moved; and wish the
like to be done with those of Venice, that I may at least get out
of the 'Albergo Imperiale,' which <i>is imperial</i> in all true sense
of the epithet. Buffini may be paid for his poison. I forgot to

<p>"Your account of the weeding of the Governor's party is very

should find it so, particularly in a place where there are not 'ten
righteous.' As to nobility&mdash;in England none are strictly noble but
peers, not even peers' sons, though titled by courtesy; nor knights
of the garter, unless of the peerage, so that Castlereagh himself
would hardly pass through a foreign herald's ordeal till the death

seems to be a regular affair of from five to fifteen years, at
which period, if there occur a widowhood, it finishes by a
sposalizio; and in the mean time it has so many rules of its own
that it is not much better. A man actually becomes a piece of

pretty trick if I had sent you, for example, cantos of 50 stanzas
each.</p>

<p>"I am translating the first Canto of Pulci's Morgante Maggiore, and
have half done it; but these last days of the Carnival confuse and
interrupt every thing.</p>

<p>"I have not yet sent off the Cantos, and have some doubt whether
they ought to be published, for they have not the spirit of the
first. The outcry has not frightened but it has <i>hurt</i> me, and I
have not written <i>con amore</i> this time. It is very decent, however,
and as dull as 'the last new comedy.'</p>

<p>"I think my translations of Pulci will make you stare. It must be
put by the original, stanza for stanza, and verse for verse; and
you will see what was permitted in a Catholic country and a bigoted
age to a churchman, on the score of religion;&mdash;and so tell those
buffoons who accuse me of attacking the Liturgy.</p>

<p>"I write in the greatest haste, it being the hour of the Corso, and
I must go and buffoon with the rest. My daughter Allegra is just
gone with the<span class="pagenum"><a id="page280" name="page280"></a>Pg 280</span> Countess G. in Count G.'s coach and six to join the
cavalcade, and I must follow with all the rest of the Ravenna

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Ravenna, February 19. 1820.</p>

<p>"I have room for you in the house here, as I had in Venice, if you
think fit to make use of it; but do not expect to find the same
gorgeous suite of tapestried halls. Neither dangers nor tropical
heats have ever prevented your penetrating wherever you had a mind
to it, and why should the snow now?&mdash;Italian snow&mdash;fie on it!&mdash;so
pray come. Tita's heart yearns for you, and mayhap for your silver
broad pieces; and your playfellow, the monkey, is alone and
inconsolable.</p>

<p>"I forget whether you admire or tolerate red hair, so that I rather
dread showing you all that I have about me and around me in this
city. Come, nevertheless,&mdash;you can pay Dante a morning visit, and I
will undertake that Theodore and Honoria will be most happy to see
you in the forest hard by. We Goths, also, of Ravenna, hope you
will not despise our arch-Goth, Theodoric. I must leave it to these
worthies to entertain you all the fore part of the day, seeing that
I have none at all myself&mdash;the<span class="pagenum"><a id="page281" name="page281"></a>Pg 281</span> lark that rouses me from my
slumbers, being an afternoon bird. But, then, all your evenings,
and as much as you can give me of your nights, will be mine. Ay!
and you will find me eating flesh, too, like yourself or any other
cannibal, except it be upon Fridays. Then, there are more Cantos
(and be d&mdash;&mdash;d to them) of what the courteous reader, Mr. S&mdash;&mdash;,
calls Grub Street, in my drawer, which I have a little scheme to
commit to your charge for England; only I must first cut up (or cut
down) two aforesaid Cantos into three, because I am grown base and
mercenary, and it is an ill precedent to let my Mec&aelig;nas, Murray,
get too much for his money. I am busy, also, with
Pulci&mdash;translating&mdash;servilely translating, stanza for stanza, and
line for line&mdash;two octaves every night,&mdash;the same allowance as at
Venice.</p>

<p>"Would you call at your banker's at Bologna, and ask him for some
letters lying there for me, and burn them?&mdash;or I will&mdash;so do not
burn them, but bring them,&mdash;and believe me ever and very
affectionately Yours,</p>

<p><b>LETTER 357. TO MR. MURRAY.</b></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Ravenna, February 21. 1820.</p>

<p>"The bull-dogs will be very agreeable. I have only those of this
country, who, though good, have<span class="pagenum"><a id="page282" name="page282"></a>Pg 282</span> not the tenacity of tooth and
stoicism in endurance of my canine fellow-citizens: then pray send
them by the readiest conveyance&mdash;perhaps best by sea. Mr. Kinnaird
will disburse for them, and deduct from the amount on your
application or that of Captain Tyler.</p>

<p>"I see the good old King is gone to his place. One can't help being
sorry, though blindness, and age, and insanity, are supposed to be
drawbacks on human felicity; but I am not at all sure that the
latter, at least, might not render him happier than any of his
subjects.</p>

<p>"I have no thoughts of coming to the coronation, though I should
like to see it, and though I have a right to be a puppet in it; but
my division with Lady Byron, which has drawn an equinoctial line
between me and mine in all other things, will operate in this also
to prevent my being in the same procession.</p>

<p>"By Saturday's post I sent you four packets, containing Cantos
third and fourth. Recollect that these two cantos reckon only as
<i>one</i> with you and me, being, in fact, the third canto cut into
two, because I found it too long. Remember this, and don't imagine
that there could be any other motive. The whole is about 225
stanzas, more or less, and a lyric of 96 lines, so that they are no
longer than the first <i>single</i> cantos: but the truth is, that I
made the first too long, and should have cut those down also had I
thought better. Instead of saying in future for so many cantos, say
so many stanzas or pages: it was Jacob Tonson's way, and certainly
the best; it<span class="pagenum"><a id="page283" name="page283"></a>Pg 283</span> prevents mistakes. I might have sent you a dozen
cantos of 40 stanzas each,&mdash;those of 'The Minstrel' (Beattie's) are
no longer,&mdash;and ruined you at once, if you don't suffer as it is.
But recollect that you are not <i>pinned down</i> to any thing you say
in a letter, and that, calculating even these two cantos as <i>one</i>
only (which they were and are to be reckoned), you are not bound by
your offer. Act as may seem fair to all parties.</p>

<p>"I have finished my translation of the first Canto of 'The Morgante
Maggiore' of Pulci, which I will transcribe and send. It is the
parent, not only of Whistlecraft, but of all jocose Italian poetry.
You must print it side by side with the original Italian, because I
wish the reader to judge of the fidelity: it is stanza for stanza,
and often line for line, if not word for word.</p>

<p>"You ask me for a volume of manners, &amp;c. on Italy. Perhaps I am in
the case to know more of them than most Englishmen, because I have
lived among the natives, and in parts of the country where
Englishmen never resided before (I speak of Romagna and this place
particularly); but there are many reasons why I do not choose to
treat in print on such a subject. I have lived in their houses and
in the heart of their families, sometimes merely as 'amico di
casa,' and sometimes as 'amico di cuore' of the Dama, and in
neither case do I feel myself authorised in making a book of them.
Their moral is not your moral; their life is not your life; you
would not understand it; it is not English, nor French, nor German,
which you would all under<span class="pagenum"><a id="page284" name="page284"></a>Pg 284</span>stand. The conventual education, the
cavalier servitude, the habits of thought and living are so
entirely different, and the difference becomes so much more
striking the more you live intimately with them, that I know not
how to make you comprehend a people who are at once temperate and
profligate, serious in their characters and buffoons in their
amusements, capable of impressions and passions, which are at once
<i>sudden</i> and <i>durable</i> (what you find in no other nation), and who
actually have no society (what we would call so), as you may see by
their comedies; they have no real comedy, not even in Goldoni, and
that is because they have no society to draw it from.</p>

<p>"Their conversazioni are not society at all. They go to the theatre
to talk, and into company to hold their tongues. The <i>women</i> sit in
a circle, and the men gather into groups, or they play at dreary
faro, or 'lotto reale,' for small sums. Their academic are concerts
like our own, with better music and more form. Their best things
are the carnival balls and masquerades, when every body runs mad
for six weeks. After their dinners and suppers they make extempore
verses and buffoon one another; but it is in a humour which you
would not enter into, ye of the north.</p>

<p>"In their houses it is better. I should know something of the
matter, having had a pretty general experience among their women,
from the fisherman's wife up to the Nobil Dama, whom I serve. Their
system has its rules, and its fitnesses, and its decorums, so as to
be reduced to a kind of discipline or game at hearts, which admits
few deviations, unless<span class="pagenum"><a id="page285" name="page285"></a>Pg 285</span> you wish to lose it. They are extremely
tenacious, and jealous as furies, not permitting their lovers even
to marry if they can help it, and keeping them always close to them
in public as in private, whenever they can. In short, they transfer
marriage to adultery, and strike the <i>not</i> out of that commandment.
The reason is, that they marry for their parents, and love for
themselves. They exact fidelity from a lover as a debt of honour,
while they pay the husband as a tradesman, that is, not at all. You
hear a person's character, male or female, canvassed not as
depending on their conduct to their husbands or wives, but to their
mistress or lover. If I wrote a quarto, I don't know that I could
do more than amplify what I have here noted. It is to be observed
that while they do all this, the greatest outward respect is to be
paid to the husbands, not only by the ladies, but by their
Serventi&mdash;particularly if the husband serves no one himself (which
is not often the case, however); so that you would often suppose
them relations&mdash;the Servente making the figure of one adopted into
the family. Sometimes the ladies run a little restive and elope, or
divide, or make a scene: but this is at starting, generally, when
they know no better, or when they fall in love with a foreigner, or
some such anomaly,&mdash;and is always reckoned unnecessary and
extravagant.</p>

<p>"You enquire after Dante's Prophecy: I have not done more than six
hundred lines, but will vaticinate at leisure.</p>

<p>"Of the bust I know nothing. No cameos or seals are to be cut here
or elsewhere that I know of, in<span class="pagenum"><a id="page286" name="page286"></a>Pg 286</span> any good style. Hobhouse should
write himself to Thorwaldsen: the bust was made and paid for three
years ago.</p>

<p>"Pray tell Mrs. Leigh to request Lady Byron to urge forward the
transfer from the funds. I wrote to Lady Byron on business this
post, addressed to the care of Mr. D. Kinnaird."</p></div>

<p>"Pulci and I are waiting for you with impatience; but I suppose we
must give way to the attraction of the Bolognese galleries for a
time. I know nothing of pictures myself, and care almost as little:
but to me there are none like the Venetian&mdash;above all, Giorgione. I
remember well his Judgment of Solomon in the Mariscalchi in
Bologna. The real mother is beautiful, exquisitely beautiful. Buy
her, by all means, if you can, and take her home with you: put her
in safety: for be assured there are troublous times brewing for
Italy; and as I never could keep out of a row in my life, it will

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Ravenna, March 1. 1820.</p>

<p>"I sent you by last post the translation of the first Canto of the
Morgante Maggiore, and wish you to ask Rose about the word
'sbergo,' <i>i.e.</i> 'usbergo,' which I have translated <i>cuirass</i>. I
suspect that it means <i>helmet</i> also. Now, if so, which of the
senses is best accordant with the text? I have adopted cuirass, but
will be amenable to reasons. Of the natives, some say one, and some
t'other: but they are no great Tuscans in Romagna. However, I will
ask Sgricci (the famous improvisatore) to-morrow, who is a native
of Arezzo. The Countess Guiccioli who is reckoned a very cultivated
young lady, and the dictionary, say <i>cuirass</i>. I have written
cuirass, but <i>helmet</i> runs in my head nevertheless&mdash;and will run in
verse very well, whilk is the principal point. I will ask the Sposa
Spina Spinelli, too, the Florentine bride of Count Gabriel Rusponi,
just imported from Florence, and get the sense out of somebody.</p>

<p>"I have just been visiting the new Cardinal, who arrived the day
before yesterday in his legation. He seems a good old gentleman,
pious and simple, and not quite like his predecessor, who was a
bon-vivant, in the worldly sense of the words.</p>

<p>"Enclosed is a letter which I received some time ago from Dallas.
It will explain itself. I have not answered it. This comes of doing
people good. At<span class="pagenum"><a id="page288" name="page288"></a>Pg 288</span> one time or another (including copyrights) this
person has had about fourteen hundred pounds of my money, and he
writes what he calls a posthumous work about me, and a scrubby
letter accusing me of treating him ill, when I never did any such
thing. It is true that I left off letter-writing, as I have done
with almost everybody else; but I can't see how that was misusing
him.</p>

<p>"I look upon his epistle as the consequence of my not sending him
another hundred pounds, which he wrote to me for about two years
ago, and which I thought proper to withhold, he having had his
share, methought, of what I could dispone upon others.</p>

<p>"In your last you ask me after my articles of domestic wants; I
believe they are as usual: the bull-dogs, magnesia, soda-powders,
tooth-powders, brushes, and every thing of the kind which are here
unattainable. You still ask me to return to England: alas! to what
purpose? You do not know what you are requiring. Return I must,
probably, some day or other (if I live), sooner or later; but it
will not be for pleasure, nor can it end in good. You enquire after
my health and SPIRITS in large letters: my health can't be very
bad, for I cured myself of a sharp tertian ague, in three weeks,
with cold water, which had held my stoutest gondolier for months,
notwithstanding all the bark of the apothecary,&mdash;a circumstance
which surprised Dr. Aglietti, who said it was a proof of great
stamina, particularly in so epidemic a season. I did it out of
dislike to the taste of bark (which I can't bear), and succeeded,<span class="pagenum"><a id="page289" name="page289"></a>Pg 289</span>
contrary to the prophecies of every body, by simply taking nothing
at all. As to <i>spirits</i>, they are unequal, now high, now low, like
other people's I suppose, and depending upon circumstances.</p>

<p>"Pray send me W. Scott's new novels. What are their names and
characters? I read some of his former ones, at least once a day,
for an hour or so. The last are too hurried: he forgets
Ravenswood's name, and calls him <i>Edgar</i> and then <i>Norman</i>; and
Girder, the cooper, is styled now <i>Gilbert</i>, and now <i>John</i>; and he
don't make enough of Montrose; but Dalgetty is excellent, and so is
Lucy Ashton, and the b&mdash;&mdash;h her mother. What is <i>Ivanhoe</i>? and what
do you call his other? are there <i>two</i>? Pray make him write at
least two a year: I like no reading so well.</p>

<p>"The editor of the Bologna Telegraph has sent me a paper with
extracts from Mr. Mulock's (his name always reminds me of Muley
Moloch of Morocco) 'Atheism answered,' in which there is a long
eulogium of my poesy, and a great 'compatimento' for my misery. I
never could understand what they mean by accusing me of irreligion.
However, they may have it their own way. This gentleman seems to be
my great admirer, so I take what he says in good part, as he
evidently intends kindness, to which I can't accuse myself of being
invincible.</p>

have rendered <i>cuirass</i> (but am not sure it is not <i>helmet</i>). I
have asked at least twenty people, learned and ignorant, male and
female, including poets, and officers civil and military. The
dictionary says <i>cuirass</i>, but gives no authority; and a female
friend of mine says <i>positively cuirass</i>, which makes me doubt the
fact still more than before. Ginguen&eacute; says 'bonnet de fer,' with
the usual superficial decision of a Frenchman, so that I can't
believe him: and what between the dictionary, the Italian woman,
and the Frenchman, there's no trusting to a word they say. The
context, too, which should decide, admits equally of either
meaning, as you will perceive. Ask Rose, Hobhouse, Merivale, and
Foscolo, and vote with the majority. Is Frere<span class="pagenum"><a id="page291" name="page291"></a>Pg 291</span> a good Tuscan? if he

<p>"I have received your letter of the 7th. Besides the four packets
you have already received, I have sent the Pulci a few days after,
and since (a few days ago) the four first Cantos of Dante's
Prophecy, (the<span class="pagenum"><a id="page295" name="page295"></a>Pg 295</span> best thing I ever wrote, if it be not
<i>unintelligible</i>,) and by last post a literal translation, word for
word (versed like the original), of the episode of Francesca of
Rimini. I want to hear what you think of the new Juans, and the
translations, and the Vision. They are all things that are, or
ought to be, very different from one another.</p>

<p>"If you choose to make a print from the Venetian, you may; but she
don't correspond at all to the character you mean her to represent.
On the contrary, the Contessa G. does (except that she is fair),
and is much prettier than the Fornarina; but I have no picture of
her except a miniature, which is very ill done; and, besides, it
would not be proper, on any account whatever, to make such a use of
it, even if you had a copy.</p>

<p>"Recollect that the two new Cantos only count with us for one. You
may put the Pulci and Dante together: perhaps that were best. So
you have put your name to Juan, after all your panic. You are a
rare fellow. I must now put myself in a passion to continue my
prose. Yours," &amp;c.</p>

<p>"Herewith you will receive a note (enclosed) on Pope, which you
will find tally with a part of the text of last post. I have at
last lost all patience with the atrocious cant and nonsense about
Pope, with which our present * *s are overflowing, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="page297" name="page297"></a>Pg 297</span> am
determined to make such head against it as an individual can, by
prose or verse; and I will at least do it with good will. There is
no bearing it any longer; and if it goes on, it will destroy what
little good writing or taste remains amongst us. I hope there are
still a few men of taste to second me; but if not, I'll battle it
alone, convinced that it is in the best cause of English
literature.</p>

<p>"I have sent you so many packets, verse and prose, lately, that you
will be tired of the postage, if not of the perusal. I want to
answer some parts of your last letter, but I have not time, for I
must 'boot and saddle,' as my Captain Craigengelt (an officer of
the old Napoleon Italian army) is in waiting, and my groom and
cattle to boot.</p>

<p>"You have given me a screed of metaphor and what not about <i>Pulci</i>,
and manners, and 'going without clothes, like our Saxon ancestors.'
Now, the <i>Saxons did not go without clothes</i>; and, in the next
place, they are not my ancestors, nor yours either; for mine were
Norman, and yours, I take it by your name, were <i>Gael</i>. And, in the
next, I differ from you about the 'refinement' which has banished
the comedies of Congreve. Are not the comedies of <i>Sheridan</i>? acted
to the thinnest houses? I know (as <i>ex-committed</i>) that 'The School
for Scandal' was the worst stock piece upon record. I also know
that Congreve gave up writing because Mrs. Centlivre's balderdash
drove his comedies off. So it is not decency, but stupidity, that
does all this; for Sheridan is as decent a writer as need be, and
Congreve no worse than Mrs. Centlivre, of whom<span class="pagenum"><a id="page298" name="page298"></a>Pg 298</span> Wilks (the actor)
said, 'not only her play would be damned, but she too.' He alluded
to 'A Bold Stroke for a Wife.' But last, and most to the purpose,
Pulci is <i>not</i> an <i>indecent</i> writer&mdash;at least in his first Canto,
as you will have perceived by this time.</p>

<p>"You talk of <i>refinement</i>:&mdash;are you all <i>more</i> moral? are you <i>so</i>
moral? No such thing. <i>I</i> know what the world is in England, by my
own proper experience of the best of it&mdash;at least of the loftiest;
and I have described it every where as it is to be found in all
places.</p>

<p>"But to return. I should like to see the <i>proofs</i> of mine answer,
because there will be something to omit or to alter. But pray let
it be carefully printed. When convenient let me have an answer.</p>

all Lent, and much better ones than any at Venice. There are small
games at hazard, that is, faro, where nobody can point more than a
shilling or two;&mdash;other card-tables, and as much talk and coffee as
you please. Every body does and says what they please; and I do not

<p>"To make the letter heavier, I enclose you the Cardinal Legate's

<p>"Post after post arrives without bringing any acknowledgment from
you of the different packets (excepting the first) which I sent
within the last two months, all of which ought to be arrived long
ere now; and as they were announced in other letters, you ought at
least to say whether they are come or not. You are not expected to
write frequent, or long letters, as your time is much occupied; but
when parcels that have cost some pains in the composition, and
great trouble in the copying, are sent to you, I should at least be
put out of suspense, by the immediate acknowledgment, per return of
post, addressed <i>directly</i> to <i>Ravenna</i>. I am naturally&mdash;knowing
what continental posts are&mdash;anxious to hear that they are arrived;
especially as I loathe the task of copying so much, that if there
was a human<span class="pagenum"><a id="page302" name="page302"></a>Pg 302</span> being that could copy my blotted MSS. he should have
all they can ever bring for his trouble. All I desire is two lines,
to say, such a day I received such a packet. There are at least six
unacknowledged. This is neither kind nor courteous.</p>

<p>"I have, besides, another reason for desiring you to be speedy,
which is, that there is THAT brewing in Italy which will speedily
cut off all security of communication, and set all your
Anglo-travellers flying in every direction, with their usual
fortitude in foreign tumults. The Spanish and French affairs have
set the Italians in a ferment; and no wonder: they have been too
long trampled on. This will make a sad scene for your exquisite
traveller, but not for the resident, who naturally wishes a people
to redress itself. I shall, if permitted by the natives, remain to
see what will come of it, and perhaps to take a turn with them,
like Dugald Dalgetty and his horse, in case of business; for I
shall think it by far the most interesting spectacle and moment in
existence, to see the Italians send the barbarians of all nations
back to their own dens. I have lived long enough among them to feel
more for them as a nation than for any other people in existence.
But they want union, and they want principle; and I doubt their
success. However, they will try, probably, and if they do, it will
be a good cause. No Italian can hate an Austrian more than I do:
unless it be the English, the Austrians seem to me the most
obnoxious race under the sky.</p>

<p>"But I doubt, if any thing be done, it won't be so quietly as in
Spain. To be sure, revolutions are<span class="pagenum"><a id="page303" name="page303"></a>Pg 303</span> not to be made with rose-water,
where there are foreigners as masters.</p>

them; you may suppress them, if you like, but I can alter nothing.
I have erased the six stanzas about those two impostors * * * *
(which I suppose will give you great pleasure), but I can do no
more. I can neither recast, nor replace; but I give you leave to
put it all into the fire, if you like, or <i>not</i> to publish, and I
think that's sufficient.</p>

<p>"I told you that I wrote on with no good will&mdash;that I had been,
<i>not</i> frightened, but <i>hurt</i> by the outcry, and, besides, that when
I wrote last November,<span class="pagenum"><a id="page305" name="page305"></a>Pg 305</span> I was ill in body, and in very great
distress of mind about some private things of my own; but you would

'either make a spoon or spoil a horn,'&mdash;and there's an end; for
there's no remeid: but I leave you free will to suppress the whole,
if you like it.</p>

<p>"About the <i>Morgante Maggiore, I won't have a line omitted</i>. It may
circulate, or it may not; but all the criticism on earth sha'n't
touch a line, unless it be because it is badly translated. Now you
say, and I say, and others say, that the translation is a good one;
and so it shall go to press as it is. Pulci must answer for his own
irreligion: I answer for the translation only.</p>

his talent in Britain: it has happened abroad before now; but on
the Continent titles are universal and worthless. Why don't you

<i>Milton's</i>? is it <i>Dryden's</i>? is it any one's except <i>Pope's</i> and

night about it, for the 'Live republics&mdash;Death to Popes and
Priests,' are innumerable, and plastered over all the palaces: ours
has plenty. There is 'Down with the Nobility,' too; they are down
enough already, for that matter. A very heavy rain and wind having

mount to-morrow, and take a canter among the peasantry, who are a
savage, resolute race, always riding with guns in their hands. I

<p>"From your not having written again, an intention which your letter
of the 7th ultimo indicated, I have to presume that the 'Prophecy
of Dante' has not been found more worthy than its predecessors in
the eyes of your illustrious synod. In that case, you will be in
some perplexity; to end which, I repeat to you, that you are not to
consider yourself as bound or pledged to publish any thing because
it is <i>mine</i>, but always to act according to your own views, or
opinions, or those of your friends; and to be sure that you will in
no degree offend me by 'declining the article,' to use a technical
phrase. The <i>prose</i> observations on John Wilson's attack, I do not
intend for publication at this time; and I send a copy of verses to
Mr. Kinnaird (they were written last year on crossing the Po) which
must <i>not</i> be published either. I mention this, because it is
probable he may give you a copy. Pray recollect this, as they are
mere verses of society, and written upon private feelings and
passions. And, moreover, I can't consent to any mutilations or
omissions of <i>Pulci</i>: the original has been ever free from such in
Italy, the capital of Christianity, and the translation may be so
in England; though you will think it strange that they should have
allowed such <i>freedom</i> for many centuries to the Morgante, while
the other day they confiscated the whole translation of the fourth
Canto of Childe Harold, and have persecuted Leoni, the
translator&mdash;so he writes me, and so I<span class="pagenum"><a id="page309" name="page309"></a>Pg 309</span> could have told him, had he
consulted me before his publication. This shows how much more
politics interest men in these parts than religion. Half a dozen
invectives against tyranny confiscate Childe Harold in a month; and
eight and twenty cantos of quizzing monks and knights, and church
government, are let loose for centuries. I copy Leoni's account.</p>

displaying her learning in presence of the great chemist, then
describing his fourteenth ascension to Mount Ve<span class="pagenum"><a id="page310" name="page310"></a>Pg 310</span>suvius, asked 'if
there was not a similar volcano in <i>Ireland</i>?' My only notion of an
Irish volcano consisted of the lake of Killarney, which I naturally
conceived her to mean; but, on second thoughts, I divined that she
alluded to <i>Ice</i>land and to Hecla&mdash;and so it proved, though she
sustained her volcanic topography for some time with all the
amiable pertinacity of 'the feminie.' She soon after turned to me
and asked me various questions about Sir Humphry's philosophy, and
I explained as well as an oracle his skill in gasen safety lamps,
and ungluing the Pompeian MSS. 'But what do you call him?' said
she. 'A great chemist,' quoth I. 'What can he do?' repeated the
lady. 'Almost any thing,' said I. 'Oh, then, mio caro, do pray beg

thousand things, and the colours all come off; and besides, they

<p>"Murray, my dear, make my respects to Thomas Campbell, and tell him
from me, with faith and friendship, three things that he must right
in his poets: Firstly, he says Anstey's Bath Guide characters are
taken from Smollett. 'Tis impossible:&mdash;the Guide was published in
1766, and Humphrey Clinker in 1771&mdash;<i>dunque</i>, 'tis Smollett who has
taken from Anstey. Secondly, he does not know to whom Cowper
alludes, when he says that there was one who 'built a church to
<i>God</i>, and then blasphemed his name:' it was 'Deo erexit
<i>Voltaire</i>' to whom that maniacal Calvinist and coddled poet
alludes. Thirdly, he misquotes and spoils a passage from
Shakspeare, 'to gild refined gold, to paint the lily,' &amp;c.; for

<p>"Now, Tom is a fine fellow; but he should be correct; for the first

<p>"I wrote to you a few days ago. There is also a letter of January
last for you at Murray's, which will explain to you why I am here.
Murray ought to have forwarded it long ago. I enclose you an
epistle from a countrywoman of yours at Paris, which has moved my
entrails. You will have the goodness, perhaps, to enquire into the
truth of her story, and I will help her as far as I can,&mdash;though
not in the useless way she proposes. Her letter is evidently
unstudied, and so natural, that the orthography is also in a state
of nature.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page314" name="page314"></a>Pg 314</span></p>

<p>"Here is a poor creature, ill and solitary, who thinks, as a last
resource, of translating you or me into French! Was there ever such
a notion? It seems to me the consummation of despair. Pray enquire,
and let me know, and, if you could draw a bill on me <i>here</i> for a
few hundred francs, at your banker's, I will duly honour it,&mdash;that
is, if she is not an impostor.<a name="FNanchor_73_73" id="FNanchor_73_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_73_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a> If not, let me know, that I may
get something remitted by my banker Longhi, of Bologna, for I have
no correspondence myself, at Paris: but tell her she must not
translate;&mdash;if she does, it will be the height of ingratitude.</p>

<p>"I had a letter (not of the same kind, but in French and flattery)
from a Madame Sophie Gail, of Paris, whom I take to be the spouse
of a Gallo-Greek of that name. Who is she? and what is she? and how
came she to take an interest in my <i>poeshie</i> or its author? If you
know her, tell her, with my compliments, that, as I only <i>read</i>
French, I have not answered her letter; but would have done so in
Italian, if I had not thought it would look like an affectation. I
have just been scolding my monkey<span class="pagenum"><a id="page315" name="page315"></a>Pg 315</span> for tearing the seal of her
letter, and spoiling a mock book, in which I put rose leaves. I had
a civet-cat the other day, too; but it ran away, after scratching
my monkey's cheek, and I am in search of it still. It was the
fiercest beast I ever saw, and like * * in the face and manner.</p>

<p>"I have a world of things to say; but, as they are not come to a
<i>d&eacute;nouement</i>, I don't care to begin their history till it is wound
up. After you went, I had a fever, but got well again without bark.
Sir Humphry Davy was here the other day, and liked Ravenna very
much. He will tell you any thing you may wish to know about the
place and your humble servitor.</p>

<p>"Your apprehensions (arising from Scott's) were unfounded. There
are <i>no damages</i> in this country, but there will probably be a
separation between them, as her family, which is a principal one,
by its connections, are very much against <i>him</i>, for the whole of
his conduct;&mdash;and he is old and obstinate, and she is young and a
woman, determined to sacrifice every thing to her affections. I
have given her the best advice, viz. to stay with him,&mdash;pointing
out the state of a separated woman, (for the priests won't let
lovers live openly together, unless the husband sanctions it,) and
making the most exquisite moral reflections,&mdash;but to no purpose.
She says, 'I will stay with him, if he will let you remain with me.
It is hard that I should be the only woman in Romagna who is not to
have her Amico; but, if not, I will not live with him; and as for
the<span class="pagenum"><a id="page316" name="page316"></a>Pg 316</span> consequences, love, &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c.'&mdash;you know how females reason
on such occasions.</p>

<p>"He says he has let it go on till he can do so no longer. But he
wants her to stay, and dismiss me; for he doesn't like to pay back
her dowry and to make an alimony. Her relations are rather for the
separation, as they detest him,&mdash;indeed, so does every body. The
populace and the women are, as usual, all for those who are in the
wrong, viz. the lady and her lover. I should have retreated, but
honour, and an erysipelas which has attacked her, prevent me,&mdash;to
say nothing of love, for I love her most entirely, though not
enough to persuade her to sacrifice every thing to a frenzy. 'I see
how it will end; she will be the sixteenth Mrs. Shuffleton.'</p>

<p>"Yours ever, B.</p>

<p>"P.S. I regret that you have not completed the Italian Fudges.
Pray, how come you to be still in Paris? Murray has four or five
things of mine in hand&mdash;the new Don Juan, which his back-shop synod

Maggiore, excellent;&mdash;short ditto from Dante, not so much approved;

furious prose answer to Blackwood's Observations on Don Juan, with
a savage Defence of Pope&mdash;likely to make a row. The opinions above
I quote from Murray and his Utican senate;&mdash;you will form your own,

<p><b>LETTER 376. TO MR. MOORE.</b></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Ravenna, June 1. 1820,</p>

<p>"I have received a Parisian letter from W.W., which I prefer
answering through you, if that worthy<span class="pagenum"><a id="page318" name="page318"></a>Pg 318</span> be still at Paris, and, as
he says, an occasional visiter of yours. In November last he wrote
to me a well-meaning letter, stating, for some reasons of his own,
his belief that a re-union might be effected between Lady B. and
myself. To this I answered as usual; and he sent me a second
letter, repeating his notions, which letter I have never answered,
having had a thousand other things to think of. He now writes as if
he believed that he had offended me by touching on the topic; and I
wish you to assure him that I am not at all so,&mdash;but, on the
contrary, obliged by his good nature. At the same time acquaint him
the <i>thing is impossible. You know this</i>, as well as I,&mdash;and there
let it end.</p>

<p>"I believe that I showed you his epistle in autumn last. He asks me
if I have heard of <i>my</i> 'laureat' at Paris<a name="FNanchor_74_74" id="FNanchor_74_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_74_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a>,&mdash;somebody who has
written 'a most sanguinary Ep&icirc;tre' against me; but whether in
French, or Dutch, or on what score, I know not, and he don't
say,&mdash;except that (for my satisfaction) he says it is the best
thing in the fellow's volume. If there is any thing of the kind
that I <i>ought</i> to know, you will doubtless tell me. I suppose it to
be something of the usual sort;&mdash;he says, he don't remember the
author's name.</p>

<p>"I wrote to you some ten days ago, and expect an answer at your
leisure.</p>

<p>"The separation business still continues, and all the world are
implicated, including priests and cardinals. The public opinion is
furious against<span class="pagenum"><a id="page319" name="page319"></a>Pg 319</span> <i>him</i>, because he ought to have cut the matter
short <i>at first</i>, and not waited twelve months to begin. He has
been trying at evidence, but can get none <i>sufficient</i>; for what
would make fifty divorces in England won't do here&mdash;there must be
the <i>most decided</i> proofs.</p>

<p>"It is the first cause of the kind attempted in Ravenna for these
two hundred years; for, though they often separate, they assign a
different motive. You know that the continental incontinent are
more delicate than the English, and don't like proclaiming their
coronation in a court, even when nobody doubts it.</p>

<p>"All her relations are furious against him. The father has
challenged him&mdash;a superfluous valour, for he don't fight, though
suspected of two assassinations&mdash;one of the famous Monzoni of
Forli. Warning was given me not to take such long rides in the Pine
Forest without being on my guard; so I take my stiletto and a pair
of pistols in my pocket during my daily rides.</p>

<p>"I won't stir from this place till the matter is settled one way or
the other. She is as femininely firm as possible; and the opinion
is so much against him, that the <i>advocates</i> decline to undertake
his cause, because they say that he is either a fool or a
rogue&mdash;fool, if he did not discover the liaison till now; and
rogue, if he did know it, and waited, for some bad end, to divulge
it. In short, there has been nothing like it since the days of
Guido di Polenta's family, in these parts.</p>

<p>"If the man has me taken off, like Polonius 'say, he<span class="pagenum"><a id="page320" name="page320"></a>Pg 320</span> made a good
end,'&mdash;for a melodrama. The principal security is, that he has not
the courage to spend twenty scudi&mdash;the average price of a
clean-handed bravo&mdash;otherwise there is no want of opportunity, for
I ride about the woods every evening, with one servant, and
sometimes an acquaintance, who latterly looks a little queer in
solitary bits of bushes.</p>

<p>"Enclosed is something which will interest you, to wit, the opinion
of <i>the</i> greatest man of Germany&mdash;perhaps of Europe&mdash;upon one of
the great men of your advertisements, (all 'famous hands,' as Jacob
Tonson used to say of his ragamuffins,)&mdash;in short, a critique of

translation, and an Italian one; keep them all in your

favourable or not, are always interesting&mdash;and this is more so, as
favourable. His <i>Faust</i> I never read, for I don't know German; but
Matthew Monk Lewis, in 1816, at Coligny, translated most of it to
me <i>viv&acirc; voce</i>, and I was naturally much struck with it; but it was
the <i>Steinbach</i> and the <i>Jungfrau</i>, and something else, much more
than Faustus, that made me write Manfred. The first scene, however,

puffing <i>Whistlecraft</i>, it <i>won't</i> do. I'll tell you why some day
or other. Cornwall's a poet, but spoilt by the detestable schools
of the day. Mrs. Hemans is a poet also, but too stiltified and
apostrophic,&mdash;and quite wrong. Men died calmly before the Christian
era, and since, without Christianity: witness the Romans, and,
lately, Thistlewood, Sandt, and Lovel&mdash;<i>men who ought to have been
weighed down with their crimes, even had they believed</i>. A deathbed
is a matter of nerves and constitution, and not of religion.
Voltaire was frightened, Frederick of Prussia not: Christians the

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>The following is the article from Goethe's "Kunst und Alterthum,"
enclosed in this letter. The grave confidence with which the venerable
critic traces the fancies of his brother poet to real persons and
events, making no difficulty even of a double murder at Florence to
furnish grounds for his theory, affords an amusing instance of the
disposition so prevalent throughout Europe, to picture Byron as a man of
marvels and mysteries, as well in his life as his poetry. To these
exaggerated, or wholly false notions of him, the numerous fictions
palmed upon the<span class="pagenum"><a id="page322" name="page322"></a>Pg 322</span> world of his romantic tours and wonderful adventures in
places he never saw, and with persons that never existed<a name="FNanchor_75_75" id="FNanchor_75_75"></a><a href="#Footnote_75_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a>, have, no
doubt, considerably contributed; and the consequence is, so utterly out
of truth and nature are the representations of his life and character
long current upon the Continent, that it may be questioned whether the
real "flesh and blood" hero of these pages,&mdash;the social,
practical-minded, and, with all his faults and eccentricities, <i>English</i>
Lord Byron,&mdash;may not, to the over-exalted imaginations of most of his
foreign admirers, appear but an ordinary, unromantic, and prosaic
personage.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>"<b>GOETHE ON MANFRED.</b></p>

<p>[1820.]</p>

<p>"Byron's tragedy, Manfred, was to me a wonderful phenomenon, and one
that closely touched me. This singular intellectual poet has taken my
Faustus to himself, and extracted from it the strongest nourishment for
his hypochondriac humour. He has made use of the impelling principles in
his own way,<span class="pagenum"><a id="page323" name="page323"></a>Pg 323</span> for his own purposes, so that no one of them remains the
same; and it is particularly on this account that I cannot enough admire
his genius. The whole is in this way so completely formed anew, that it
would be an interesting task for the critic to point out not only the
alterations he has made, but their degree of resemblance with, or
dissimilarity to, the original: in the course of which I cannot deny
that the gloomy heat of an unbounded and exuberant despair becomes at
last oppressive to us. Yet is the dissatisfaction we feel always
connected with esteem and admiration.</p>

<p>"We find thus in this tragedy the quintessence of the most astonishing
talent born to be its own tormentor. The character of Lord Byron's life
and poetry hardly permits a just and equitable appreciation. He has
often enough confessed what it is that torments him. He has repeatedly
pourtrayed it; and scarcely any one feels compassion for this
intolerable suffering, over which he is ever laboriously ruminating.
There are, properly speaking, two females whose phantoms for ever haunt
him, and which, in this piece also, perform principal parts&mdash;one under
the name of Astarte, the other without form or actual presence, and
merely a voice. Of the horrid occurrence which took place with the
former, the following is related:&mdash;When a bold and enterprising young
man, he won the affections of a Florentine lady. Her husband discovered
the amour, and murdered his wife; but the murderer was the same night
found dead in the street, and there was<span class="pagenum"><a id="page324" name="page324"></a>Pg 324</span> no one on whom any suspicion
could be attached. Lord Byron removed from Florence, and these spirits
haunted him all his life after.</p>

<p>"This romantic incident is rendered highly probable by innumerable
allusions to it in his poems. As, for instance, when turning his sad
contemplations inwards, he applies to himself the fatal history of the
king of Sparta. It is as follows:&mdash;Pausanias, a Lacedemonian general,
acquires glory by the important victory at Plat&aelig;a, but afterwards
forfeits the confidence of his countrymen through his arrogance,
obstinacy, and secret intrigues with the enemies of his country. This
man draws upon himself the heavy guilt of innocent blood, which attends
him to his end; for, while commanding the fleet of the allied Greeks, in
the Black Sea, he is inflamed with a violent passion for a Byzantine
maiden. After long resistance, he at length obtains her from her
parents, and she is to be delivered up to him at night. She modestly
desires the servant to put out the lamp, and, while groping her way in
the dark, she overturns it. Pausanias is awakened from his
sleep&mdash;apprehensive of an attack from murderers, he seizes his sword,
and destroys his mistress. The horrid sight never leaves him. Her shade
pursues him unceasingly, and he implores for aid in vain from the gods
and the exorcising priests.</p>

<p>"That poet must have a lacerated heart who selects such a scene from
antiquity, appropriates it to himself, and burdens his tragic image with
it. The following soliloquy, which is overladen with gloom and a
weariness of life, is, by this remark, ren<span class="pagenum"><a id="page325" name="page325"></a>Pg 325</span>dered intelligible. We
recommend it as an exercise to all friends of declamation. Hamlet's
soliloquy appears improved upon here."<a name="FNanchor_76_76" id="FNanchor_76_76"></a><a href="#Footnote_76_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a></p>

<p>"Galignani has just sent me the Paris edition of your works (which
I wrote to order), and I am glad to see my old friends with a
French face. I have been skimming and dipping, in and over them,
like a swallow, and as pleased as one. It is the first time that I
had seen the Melodies without music; and, I don't know how, but I
can't read in a music-book&mdash;the crotchets confound the words in my
head, though I recollect them perfectly when <i>sung</i>. Music assists
my memory through the ear, not through the eye; I mean, that her
quavers perplex me upon paper, but they are a help when heard. And
thus I was glad to see the words without their borrowed robes;&mdash;to
my mind they look none the worse for their nudity.</p>

<p>"The biographer has made a botch of your life&mdash;calling your father
'a <i>venerable old</i> gentleman,' and prattling of 'Addison,' and
'dowager countesses.' If that damned fellow was to <i>write my</i> life,
I would certainly <i>take his</i>. And then, at the Dublin dinner, you
have 'made a speech' (do you recollect, at<span class="pagenum"><a id="page326" name="page326"></a>Pg 326</span> Douglas K.'s, 'Sir, he
made me a speech?') too complimentary to the 'living poets,' and
somewhat redolent of universal praise. <i>I</i> am but too well off in
it, but * * *.</p>

ever done, or sung, has been owing to that confounded book of
yours.</p>

<p>"In my last I told you of a cargo of 'Poeshie,' which I had sent to
M. at his own impatient desire;&mdash;and, now he has got it, he don't
like it, and demurs. Perhaps he is right. I have no great opinion
of any of my last shipment, except a translation from Pulci, which
is word for word, and verse for verse.</p>

<p>"I am in the third Act of a Tragedy; but whether it will be
finished or not, I know not: I have, at this present, too many
passions of my own on hand to do justice to those of the dead.
Besides the vexations mentioned in my last, I have incurred a
quarrel with the Pope's carabiniers, or gens d'armerie, who have
petitioned the Cardinal against my liveries, as resembling too
nearly their own lousy uniform. They particularly object to the
epaulettes, which all the world with us have on upon gala days. My

<p>"To remove or increase your Irish anxiety about my being 'in a
wisp<a name="FNanchor_77_77" id="FNanchor_77_77"></a><a href="#Footnote_77_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a>,' I answer your letter forth-with; premising that, as I am
a '<i>Will</i> of the wisp,' I may chance to flit out of it. But, first,
a word on the Memoir;&mdash;I have no objection, nay, I would rather
that <i>one</i> correct copy was taken and deposit<span class="pagenum"><a id="page328" name="page328"></a>Pg 328</span>ed in honourable
hands, in case of accidents happening to the original; for you know
that I have none, and have never even <i>re</i>-read, nor, indeed,
<i>read</i> at all what is there written; I only know that I wrote it
with the fullest intention to be 'faithful and true' in my
narrative, but <i>not</i> impartial&mdash;no, by the Lord! I can't pretend to
be that, while I feel. But I wish to give every body concerned the
opportunity to contradict or correct me.</p>

<p>"I have no objection to any proper person seeing what is there
written,&mdash;seeing it was written, like every thing else, for the
purpose of being read, however much many writings may fail in
arriving at that object.</p>

<p>"With regard to 'the wisp,' the Pope has pronounced <i>their
separation</i>. The decree came yesterday from Babylon,&mdash;it was <i>she</i>
and <i>her friends</i> who demanded it, on the grounds of her husband's
(the noble Count Cavalier's) extraordinary usage. <i>He</i> opposed it
with all his might because of the alimony, which has been assigned,
with all her goods, chattels, carriage, &amp;c. to be restored by him.
In Italy they can't divorce. He insisted on her giving me up, and
he would forgive every thing,&mdash;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*<br />

country, the very courts hold such proofs in abhorrence, the
Italians being as much more delicate in public than the English, as
they are more passionate in private.</p>

<p>"The friends and relatives, who are numerous and powerful, reply to
him&mdash;'<i>You</i>, yourself, are either fool or knave,&mdash;fool, if you did
not see the conse<span class="pagenum"><a id="page329" name="page329"></a>Pg 329</span>quences of the approximation of these two young

break out (after twelve months of the closest intimacy, under your
own eyes and positive sanction) with a scandal, which can only make
you ridiculous and her unhappy.'</p>

<p>"He swore that he thought our intercourse was purely amicable, and
that <i>I</i> was more partial to him than to her, till melancholy
testimony proved the contrary. To this they answer, that 'Will of
<i>this</i> wisp' was not an unknown person, and that 'clamosa Fama' had
not proclaimed the purity of my morals;&mdash;that <i>her</i> brother, a year
ago, wrote from Rome to warn him that his wife would infallibly be
led astray by this ignis fatuus, unless he took proper measures,
all of which he neglected to take, &amp;c. &amp;c.</p>

quanti piedi di acqua siamo</i>,' and he has found enough to drown him
in. In short,</p>

<p>It is but to let the women alone, in the way of conflict, for they
are sure to win against the field. She returns to her father's
house, and I can only see her under great restrictions&mdash;such is the
custom of the country. The relations behave very well:&mdash;I offered
any settlement, but they refused to accept it, and swear she
<i>shan't</i> live with G. (as he has tried to prove her faithless), but
that he shall maintain her;<span class="pagenum"><a id="page330" name="page330"></a>Pg 330</span> and, in fact, a judgment to this
effect came yesterday. I am, of course, in an awkward situation
enough.</p>

<p>"I have heard no more of the carabiniers who protested against my
liveries. They are not popular, those same soldiers, and, in a
small row, the other night, one was slain, another wounded, and
divers put to flight, by some of the Romagnuole youth, who are
dexterous, and somewhat liberal of the knife. The perpetrators are
not discovered, but I hope and believe that none of my ragamuffins
were in it, though they are somewhat savage, and secretly armed,
like most of the inhabitants. It is their way, and saves sometimes
a good deal of litigation.</p>

<p>"There is a revolution at Naples. If so, it will probably leave a
card at Ravenna in its way to Lombardy.</p>

<p>"Your publishers seem to have used you like mine. M. has shuffled,
and almost insinuated that my last productions are <i>dull</i>. Dull,
sir!&mdash;damme, dull! I believe he is right. He begs for the
completion of my tragedy on Marino Faliero, none of which is yet
gone to England. The fifth act is nearly completed, but it is
dreadfully long&mdash;40 sheets of long paper of 4 pages each&mdash;about 150
when printed; but 'so full of pastime and prodigality' that I think
it will do.</p>

<p>"Pray send and publish your <i>Pome</i> upon me; and don't be afraid of

for doubting if there be any such place!</p>

<p>"So my Gail is gone&mdash;and Miss Mah<i>ony</i> won't take <i>Mo</i>ney. I am

not to translate me.</p>

<p>"Oh, pray tell Galignani that I shall send him a screed of doctrine
if he don't be more punctual. Somebody <i>regularly detains two</i>, and
sometimes <i>four</i>, of his Messengers by the way. Do, pray, entreat
him to be more precise. News are worth money in this remote kingdom
of the Ostrogoths.</p>

<p>In the separation that had now taken place between Count Guiccioli and
his wife, it was one of the conditions that the lady should, in future,
reside under the paternal roof:&mdash;in consequence of which, Madame
Guiccioli, on the 16th of July, left Ravenna and retired to a villa
belonging to Count Gamba, about fifteen miles distant from that city.
Here Lord Byron occasionally visited her&mdash;about once or twice, perhaps,
in a month&mdash;passing the rest of his time in perfect solitude. To a mind
like his, whose world was within itself, such a mode of life could have
been neither new nor unwelcome; but to the woman, young and admired,
whose acquaint<span class="pagenum"><a id="page332" name="page332"></a>Pg 332</span>ance with the world and its pleasures had but just begun,
this change was, it must be confessed, most sudden and trying. Count
Guiccioli was rich, and, as a young wife, she had gained absolute power
over him. She was proud, and his station placed her among the highest in
Ravenna. They had talked of travelling to Naples, Florence, Paris,&mdash;and
every luxury, in short, that wealth could command was at her disposal.</p>

<p>All this she now voluntarily and determinedly sacrificed for Byron. Her
splendid home abandoned&mdash;her relations all openly at war with her&mdash;her
kind father but tolerating, from fondness, what he could not
approve&mdash;she was now, upon a pittance of 200<i>l.</i> a year, living apart
from the world, her sole occupation the task of educating herself for
her illustrious friend, and her sole reward the few brief glimpses of
him which their now restricted intercourse allowed. Of the man who could
inspire and keep alive so devoted a feeling, it may be pronounced with
confidence that he could not have been such as, in the freaks of his own
wayward humour, he represented himself; while, on the lady's side, the
whole history of her attachment goes to prove how completely an Italian
woman, whether by nature or from her social position, is led to invert
the usual course of such frailties among ourselves, and, weak in
resisting the first impulses of passion, to reserve the whole strength
of her character for a display of constancy and devotedness afterwards.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page333" name="page333"></a>Pg 333</span></p>

<p><b>LETTER 380. TO MR. MURRAY.</b></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Ravenna, July 17. 1820.</p>

<p>"I have received some books, and Quarterlies, and Edinburghs, for
all which I am grateful: they contain all I know of England, except
by Galignani's newspaper.</p>

<p>"The tragedy is completed, but now comes the task of copy and
correction. It is very long, (42 <i>sheets</i> of long paper, of four
pages each,) and I believe must make more than 140 or 150 pages,
besides many historical extracts as notes, which I mean to append.
History is closely followed. Dr. Moore's account is in some
respects false, and in all foolish and flippant. <i>None</i> of the
chronicles (and I have consulted Sanuto, Sandi, Navagero, and an
anonymous Siege of Zara, besides the histories of Laugier, Daru,
Sismondi, &amp;c.) state, or even hint, that he begged his life; they
merely say that he did not deny the conspiracy. He was one of their
great men,&mdash;commanded at the siege of Zara,&mdash;beat 80,000
Hungarians, killing 8000, and at the same time kept the town he was
besieging in order,&mdash;took Capo d'Istria,&mdash;was ambassador at Genoa,
Rome, and finally Doge, where he fell for treason, in attempting to
alter the government, by what Sanuto calls a judgment on him for,
many years before (when Podesta and Captain of Treviso), having
knocked down a bishop, who was sluggish in carrying the host at a
procession. He 'saddles him,' as Thwackum did Square, 'with a
judgment;' but he does not mention whether he had been punished at<span class="pagenum"><a id="page334" name="page334"></a>Pg 334</span>
the time for what would appear very strange, even now, and must
have been still more so in an age of papal power and glory. Sanuto
says, that Heaven took away his senses for this buffet, and induced
him to conspire. 'Per&ograve; f&ugrave; permesso che il Faliero perdette
l'intelletto,' &amp;c.</p>

<p>"I do not know what your parlour-boarders will think of the Drama I
have founded upon this extraordinary event. The only similar one in
history is the story of Agis, King of Sparta, a prince <i>with</i> the
commons against the aristocracy, and losing his life therefor. But
it shall be sent when copied.</p>

<p>"I should be glad to know why your Quarter<i>ing</i> Reviewers, at the
close of 'The Fall of Jerusalem,' accuse me of Manicheism? a
compliment to which the sweetener of 'one of the mightiest spirits'
by no means reconciles me. The poem they review is very noble; but
could they not do justice to the writer without converting him into
my religious antidote? I am not a Manichean, nor an <i>Any</i>-chean. I
should like to know what harm my 'poeshies' have done? I can't tell
what people mean by making me a hobgoblin."</p></div>

<p>"I have '<i>put my soul</i>' into the tragedy (as you <i>if</i> it); but you

that it is not a political play, though it may look like it: it is

thing happens, you have matter for a posthumous work, in MS.; so

they begin here. The French courage proceeds from vanity, the
German from phlegm, the Turkish from fanaticism and opium, the
Spanish from pride, the English from coolness, the Dutch from
obstinacy, the Russian from insensibility, but the <i>Italian</i> from

<p>"Nobody here believes a word of the evidence against the Queen. The
very mob cry shame against their countrymen, and say, that for half
the money spent upon the trial, any testimony whatever may be
brought out of Italy. This you may rely upon as fact. I told you as
much before. As to what travellers report, what <i>are travellers</i>?
Now I have <i>lived</i> among the Italians&mdash;not <i>Florenced</i>, and

<p><b>LETTER 388. TO MR. MURRAY.</b></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Ravenna, Sept. 28. 1820.</p>

<p>"I thought that I had told you long ago, that it never was intended
nor written with any view to the stage. I have said so in the
preface too. It is too long and too regular for your stage, the
persons too few, and the <i>unity</i> too much observed. It is more like
a play of Alfieri's than of your stage (I say this humbly in
speaking of that great man); but there is poetry, and it is equal
to Manfred, though I know not what esteem is held of Manfred.</p>

<p>"I have now been nearly as long <i>out</i> of England as I was there
during the time I saw you frequently. I came home July 14th, 1811,
and left again April 25th, 1816: so that Sept. 28th, 1820, brings
me within a very few months of the same duration of time of my stay
and my absence. In course, I can know nothing of the public taste
and feelings, but from what I glean from letters, &amp;c. Both seem to
be as bad as possible.</p>

<p>"I thought <i>Anastasius excellent</i>: did I not say so? Matthews's
Diary most excellent; it, and Forsyth, and parts of Hobhouse, are
all we have of truth or sense upon Italy. The Letter to Julia very
good<span class="pagenum"><a id="page343" name="page343"></a>Pg 343</span> indeed, I do not despise * * * * * *; but if she knit blue
stockings instead of wearing them, it would be better. <i>You</i> are
taken in by that false stilted trashy style, which is a mixture of
all the styles of the day, which are <i>all bombastic</i> (I don't
except my <i>own</i>&mdash;no one has done more through negligence to corrupt
the language); but it is neither English nor poetry. Time will
show.</p>

<p>"I am sorry Gifford has made no further remarks beyond the first
Act: does he think all the English equally sterling as he thought
the first? You did right to send the proofs: I was a fool; but I do
really detest the sight of proofs: it is an absurdity; but comes
from laziness.</p>

<p>"You can steal the two Juans into the world quietly, tagged to the
others. The play as you will&mdash;the Dante too; but the <i>Pulci</i> I am
proud of: it is superb; you have no such translation. It is the
best thing I ever did in my life. I wrote the play from beginning
to end, and not a <i>single scene without interruption</i>, and being
obliged to break off in the middle; for I had my hands full, and my
head, too, just then; so it can be no great shakes&mdash;I mean the
play; and the head too, if you like.</p>

<p>"P.S. Politics here still savage and uncertain. However, we are all
in our 'bandaliers,' to join the 'Highlanders if they cross the
Forth,' <i>i.e.</i> to crush the Austrians if they cross the Po. The
rascals!&mdash;and that dog Liverpool, to say their subjects are
<i>happy</i>! If ever I come back, I'll work some of these ministers.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page344" name="page344"></a>Pg 344</span></p>

<p>"Sept. 29.</p>

<p>"I opened my letter to say, that on reading <i>more</i> of the four
volumes on Italy, where the author says 'declined an introduction,'
I perceive (<i>horresco referens</i>) it is written by a WOMAN!!! In
that case you must suppress my note and answer, and all I have said
about the book and the writer. I never dreamed of it until now, in
my extreme wrath at that precious note. I can only say that I am
sorry that a lady should say any thing of the kind. What I would
have said to one of the other sex you know already. Her book too
(as a <i>she</i> book) is not a bad one; but she evidently don't know
the Italians, or rather don't like them, and forgets the <i>causes</i>
of their misery and profligacy (<i>Matthews</i> and <i>Forsyth</i> are your
men for truth and tact), and has gone over Italy in
<i>company</i>&mdash;<i>always</i> a <i>bad</i> plan: you must be <i>alone</i> with people
to know them well. Ask her, who was the '<i>descendant of Lady M.W.
Montague</i>,' and by whom? by Algarotti?</p>

<p>"I suspect that, in Marino Faliero, you and yours won't like the
<i>politics</i>, which are perilous to you in these times; but recollect
that it is <i>not a political</i> play, and that I was obliged to put
into the mouths of the characters the sentiments upon which they
acted. I hate all things written like Pizarro, to represent France,
England, and so forth. All I have done is meant to be purely
Venetian, even to the very prophecy of its present state.</p>

<p>"Your Angles in general know little of the <i>Italians</i>, who detest
them for their numbers and their GENOA treachery. Besides, the
English tra<span class="pagenum"><a id="page345" name="page345"></a>Pg 345</span>vellers have not been composed of the best company. How
could they?&mdash;out of 100,000, how many gentlemen were there, or
honest men?</p>

<p>"Mitchell's Aristophanes is excellent. Send me the rest of it.</p>

<p>"These fools will force me to write a book about Italy myself, to
give them 'the loud lie.' They prate about assassination; what is
it but the origin of duelling&mdash;and '<i>a wild justice</i>,' as Lord
Bacon calls it? It is the fount of the modern point of honour in
what the laws can't or <i>won't</i> reach. Every man is liable to it
more or less, according to circumstances or place. For instance, I
am living here exposed to it daily, for I have happened to make a
powerful and unprincipled man my enemy;&mdash;and I never sleep the
worse for it, or ride in less solitary places, because precaution
is useless, and one thinks of it as of a disease which may or may
not strike. It is true that there are those here, who, if he did,
would 'live to think on't;' but that would not awake my bones: I
should be sorry if it would, were they once at rest."</p></div>

<p><b>LETTER 389. TO MR. MURRAY.</b></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Ravenna, 8bre 6&deg;, 1820.</p>

<p>"You will have now received all the Acts, corrected, of the Marino
Faliero. What you say of the 'bet of 100 guineas' made by some one
who says that he saw me last week, reminds me of what happened in
1810: you can easily ascertain the fact, and it is an odd one.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page346" name="page346"></a>Pg 346</span>"In the latter end of 1811, I met one evening at the Alfred my old
school and form fellow (for we were within two of each other, <i>he</i>
the higher, though both very near the top of our remove,) <i>Peel</i>,
the Irish secretary. He told me that, in 1810, he met me, as he
thought, in St. James's Street, but we passed without speaking. He
mentioned this, and it was denied as impossible, I being then in
Turkey. A day or two afterward, he pointed out to his brother a
person on the opposite side of the way:&mdash;'There,' said he, 'is the
man whom I took for Byron.' His brother instantly answered, 'Why,
it is Byron, and no one else.' But this is not all:&mdash;I was <i>seen</i>
by somebody to <i>write down my name</i> amongst the enquirers after the
King's health, then attacked by insanity. Now, at this very period,
as nearly as I could make out, I was ill of a <i>strong fever</i> at
Patras, caught in the marshes near Olympia, from the <i>malaria</i>. If
I had died there, this would have been a new ghost story for you.
You can easily make out the accuracy of this from Peel himself, who
told it in detail. I suppose you will be of the opinion of
Lucretius, who (denies the immortality of the soul, but) asserts
that from the 'flying off of the surfaces of bodies, these surfaces
or cases, like the coats of an onion, are sometimes seen entire
when they are separated from it, so that the shapes and shadows of
both the dead and living are frequently beheld.'</p>

<p>"But if they are, are their coats and waistcoats also seen? I do
not disbelieve that we may be two by some unconscious process, to a
certain sign, but which of these two I happen at present to be, I<span class="pagenum"><a id="page347" name="page347"></a>Pg 347</span>
leave you to decide. I only hope that <i>t'other me</i> behaves like a
gemman.</p>

<p>"I wish you would get Peel asked how far I am accurate in my
recollection of what he told me; for I don't like to say such
things without authority.</p>

<p>"I am not sure that I was <i>not spoken</i> with; but this also you can
ascertain. I have written to you such letters that I stop.</p>

<p>"Yours, &amp;c.</p>

<p>"P.S. Last year (in June, 1819), I met at Count Mosti's, at
Ferrara, an Italian who asked me 'if I knew Lord Byron?' I told him
<i>no</i> (no one knows himself, <i>you</i> know). 'Then,' says he, 'I do; I
met him at Naples the other day.' I pulled out my card and asked
him if that was the way he spelt his name: he answered, <i>yes</i>. I
suspect that it was a blackguard navy surgeon, who attended a young
travelling madam about, and passed himself for a lord at the
post-houses. He was a vulgar dog&mdash;quite of the cock-pit order&mdash;and
a precious representative I must have had of him, if it was even
so; but I don't know. He passed himself off as a gentleman, and
squired about a Countess * * (of this place), then at Venice, an
ugly battered woman, of bad morals even for Italy."</p></div>

<p><b>LETTER 390. TO MR. MURRAY.</b></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Ravenna, 8bre 8&deg;, 1820.</p>

<p>"Foscolo's letter is exactly the thing wanted; firstly, because he
is a man of genius; and, next,<span class="pagenum"><a id="page348" name="page348"></a>Pg 348</span> because he is an Italian, and
therefore the best judge of Italics. Besides,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i4">"He's more an antique Roman than a Dane;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>that is, he is more of the ancient Greek than of the modern
Italian. Though 'somewhat,' as Dugald Dalgetty says, 'too wild and
sa<i>l</i>vage' (like 'Ronald of the Mist'), 'tis a wonderful man, and
my friends Hobhouse and Rose both swear by him; and they are good
judges of men and of Italian humanity.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i4">"Here are in all <i>two</i> worthy voices gain'd:<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Gifford says it is good 'sterling genuine English,' and Foscolo
says that the characters are right Venetian. Shakspeare and Otway
had a million of advantages over me, besides the incalculable one
of being <i>dead</i> from one to two centuries, and having been both
born blackguards (which ARE such attractions to the gentle living
reader); let me then preserve the only one which I could possibly
have&mdash;that of having been at Venice, and entered more into the
local spirit of it. I claim no more.</p>

<p>"I know what Foscolo means about Calendaro's <i>spitting</i> at Bertram;
<i>that's</i> national&mdash;the objection, I mean. The Italians and French,
with those 'flags of abomination,' their pocket handkerchiefs, spit
there, and here, and every where else&mdash;in your face almost, and
therefore <i>object</i> to it on the stage as <i>too familiar</i>. But we who
<i>spit</i> nowhere&mdash;but in a man's face when we grow savage&mdash;are not
likely to feel this. Remember <i>Massinger</i>, and Kean's Sir Giles
Overreach&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i4">"Lord! <i>thus</i> I <i>spit</i> at thee and at thy counsel!<br /></span>
</div></div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page349" name="page349"></a>Pg 349</span></p>
<p>Besides, Calendaro does <i>not</i> spit in Bertram's face; he spits <i>at</i>
him, as I have seen the Mussulmans do upon the ground when they are
in a rage. Again, he <i>does not in fact despise</i> Bertram, though he
affects it&mdash;as we all do, when angry with one we think our
inferior. He is angry at not being allowed to die in his own way
(although not afraid of death); and recollect that he suspected and
hated Bertram from the first. Israel Bertuccio, on the other hand,
is a cooler and more concentrated fellow: he acts upon <i>principle
and impulse</i>; Calendaro upon <i>impulse</i> and <i>example</i>.</p>

<p>"So there's argument for you.</p>

<p>"The Doge <i>repeats</i>;&mdash;<i>true</i>, but it is from engrossing passion,
and because he sees <i>different</i> persons, and is always obliged to
recur to the <i>cause</i> uppermost in his mind. His speeches are
long:&mdash;true, but I wrote for the <i>closet</i>, and on the French and
Italian model rather than yours, which I think not very highly of,
for all your <i>old</i> dramatists, who are long enough too, God
knows:&mdash;<i>look</i> into any of them.</p>

<p>"I return you Foscolo's letter, because it alludes also to his
private affairs. I am sorry to see such a man in straits, because I
know what they are, or what they were. I never met but three men
who would have held out a finger to me: one was yourself, the other
William Bankes, and the other a nobleman long ago dead: but of
these the first was the only one who offered it while I <i>really</i>
wanted it; the second from good will&mdash;but I was not in need of
Bankes's aid, and would not have accepted it if I<span class="pagenum"><a id="page350" name="page350"></a>Pg 350</span> had (though I
love and esteem him); and the <i>third</i> &mdash;&mdash;&nbsp;&nbsp;&mdash;&mdash;.<a name="FNanchor_82_82" id="FNanchor_82_82"></a><a href="#Footnote_82_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a></p>

<p>"So you see that I have seen some strange things in my time. As for
your own offer, it was in 1815, when I was in actual uncertainty of
five pounds. I rejected it; but I have not forgotten it, although
you probably have.</p>

<p>"P.S. Foscolo's Ricciardo was lent, with the <i>leaves uncut</i>, to
some Italians, now in villeggiatura, so that I have had no
opportunity of hearing their decision, or of reading it. They
seized on it as Foscolo's, and on account of the beauty of the
paper and printing, directly. If I find it takes, I will reprint it
<i>here</i>. The Italians think as highly of Foscolo as they can of any
man, divided and miserable as they are, and with neither leisure at
present to read, nor head nor heart to judge of any thing but
extracts from French newspapers and the Lugano Gazette.</p>

<p>"We are all looking at one another, like wolves on their prey in
pursuit, only waiting for the first falling on to do unutterable
things. They are a great world in chaos, or angels in hell, which
you please; but out of chaos came Paradise, and out of hell&mdash;I
don't know what; but the devil went <i>in</i> there, and he was a fine
fellow once, you know.</p>

<p>"You need never favour me with any periodical publication, except
the Edinburgh Quarterly, and an occasional Blackwood; or now and
then a Monthly Review; for the rest I do not feel curiosity enough
to look beyond their covers.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page351" name="page351"></a>Pg 351</span></p>

<p>"To be sure I took in the British finely. He fell precisely into
the glaring trap laid for him. It was inconceivable how he could be
so absurd as to imagine us serious with him.</p>

<p>"Recollect, that if you put my name to 'Don Juan' in these canting
days, any lawyer might oppose my guardian right of my daughter in
Chancery, on the plea of its containing the <i>parody</i>;&mdash;such are the
perils of a foolish jest. I was not aware of this at the time, but
you will find it correct, I believe; and you may be sure that the
Noels would not let it slip. Now I prefer my child to a poem at any
time, and so should you, as having half a dozen.</p>

<p>"Let me know your notions.</p>

<p>"If you turn over the earlier pages of the Huntingdon peerage
story, you will see how common a name Ada was in the early
Plantagenet days. I found it in my own pedigree in the reign of
John and Henry, and gave it to my daughter. It was also the name of
Charlemagne's sister. It is in an early chapter of Genesis, as the
name of the wife of Lamech; and I suppose Ada is the feminine of
<i>Adam</i>. It is short, ancient, vocalic, and had been in my family;
for which reason I gave it to my daughter."</p></div>

<p>the only book in four <i>living</i> volumes I would give a baioccolo to
see&mdash;'bating the rest of the same author, and an occasional
Edinburgh and Quarterly, as brief chroniclers of the times. Instead
of this, here are Johnny Keats's * * poetry, and three novels by
God knows whom, except that there is Peg * * *'s name to one of
them&mdash;a spinster whom I thought we had sent back to her spinning.
Crayon is very good; Hogg's Tales rough, but RACY, and welcome.</p>

<p>"Books of travels are expensive, and I don't want them, having
travelled already; besides, they lie. Thank the author of 'The
Profligate' for his (or her) present. Pray send me <i>no more</i> poetry
but what is rare and decidedly good. There is such a trash of Keats
and the like upon my tables that I am ashamed to look at them. I
say nothing against your parsons, your S * *s and your C * *s&mdash;it
is all very fine&mdash;but pray dispense me from the pleasure. Instead
of poetry, if you will favour me with a few soda-powders, I shall
be delighted: but all prose ('bating <i>travels</i> and novels NOT by
Scott) is welcome, especially Scott's Tales of my Landlord, and so
on.</p>

<p>"In the notes to Marino Faliero, it may be as well to say that
'<i>Benintende</i>' was not really of <i>the Ten</i>, but merely <i>Grand
Chancellor</i>, a separate office (although important): it was an
arbitrary alteration<span class="pagenum"><a id="page353" name="page353"></a>Pg 353</span> of mine. The Doges too were all <i>buried</i> in
St. <i>Mark's before</i> Faliero. It is singular that when his
predecessor, Andrea Dandolo, died, <i>the Ten</i> made a law that <i>all</i>
the <i>future Doges</i> should be <i>buried with their families, in their
own churches,&mdash;one would think by a kind of presentiment</i>. So that
all that is said of his <i>ancestral Doges</i>, as buried at St. John's
and Paul's, is altered from the fact, <i>they being in St. Mark's.
Make a note</i> of this, and put <i>Editor</i> as the subscription to it.</p>

<p>"As I make such pretensions to accuracy, I should not like to be
<i>twitted</i> even with such trifles on that score. Of the play they
may say what they please, but not so of my costume and <i>dram.
pers.</i> they having been real existences.</p>

<p>"I omitted Foscolo in my list of living <i>Venetian worthies, in the
notes</i>, considering him as an <i>Italian</i> in general, and not a mere
provincial like the rest; and as an Italian I have spoken of him in
the preface to Canto 4th of Childe Harold.</p>

<p>"The French translation of us!!! <i>oim&egrave;! oim&egrave;!</i>&mdash;the German; but I
don't understand the latter and his long dissertation at the end
about the Fausts. Excuse haste. Of politics it is not safe to
speak, but nothing is decided as yet.</p>

<p>"I am in a very fierce humour at not having Scott's Monastery. You
are <i>too liberal</i> in quantity, and somewhat careless of the
quality, of your missives. All the <i>Quarterlies</i> (four in number) I
had had before from you, and <i>two</i> of the Edinburgh; but no matter;
we shall have new ones by and by. No more Keats, I entreat:&mdash;flay
him alive; if some<span class="pagenum"><a id="page354" name="page354"></a>Pg 354</span> of you don't, I must skin him myself. There is
no bearing the drivelling idiotism of the manikin.</p>

<p>"I don't feel inclined to care further about 'Don Juan.' What do
you think a very pretty Italian lady said to me the other day? She
had read it in the French, and paid me some compliments, with due
DRAWBACKS, upon it. I answered that what she said was true, but
that I suspected it would live longer than Childe Harold. '<i>Ah
but</i>' (said she). '<i>I would rather have the fame of Childe Harold
for three years than an</i> IMMORTALITY <i>of Don Juan!</i>' The truth is
that <i>it is</i> TOO TRUE, and the women hate many things which strip
off the tinsel of <i>sentiment</i>; and they are right, as it would rob
them of their weapons. I never knew a woman who did not hate <i>De
Grammont's Memoirs</i> for the same reason: even Lady * * used to
abuse them.</p>

<p>"Rose's work I never received. It was seized at Venice. Such is the
liberality of the Huns, with their two hundred thousand men, that
they dare not let such a volume as his circulate."</p></div>

<p>Now, of these 'ten thousand authors,' there are actually nineteen
hundred and eighty-seven poets, all alive at this moment, whatever
their works may be, as their booksellers well know; and amongst
these there are several who possess a far greater reputation than
mine, although considerably less than yours. It is owing to this
neglect on the part of your German translators that you are not
aware of the works of * * *.</p>

<p>"There is also another, named * * * *</p>

<p>"I mention these poets by way of sample to enlighten you. They form
but two bricks of our Babel, (WINDSOR bricks, by the way,) but may
serve for a specimen of the building.</p>

<p>"It is, moreover, asserted that 'the predominant character of the
whole body of the present English poetry is a <i>disgust</i> and
<i>contempt</i> for life.' But I rather suspect that, by one single work
of <i>prose</i>, <i>you</i> yourself have excited a greater contempt for life
than all the English volumes of poesy that ever were written.
Madame de Sta&euml;l says, that 'Werther has occasioned more suicides
than the most beautiful woman;' and I really believe that he has
put more individuals out of this world than Napoleon himself,
except in the way of his profession. Perhaps, Illustrious Sir, the
acrimonious judgment passed by a celebrated northern journal upon
you in particular, and the Germans in general, has rather
indisposed you towards English poetry as well as criticism. But you
must not regard our critics, who are at bottom good-natured
fellows, considering their two professions,&mdash;taking up the law in
court, and laying<span class="pagenum"><a id="page358" name="page358"></a>Pg 358</span> it down out of it. No one can more lament their
hasty and unfair judgment, in your particular, than I do; and I so
expressed myself to your friend Schlegel, in 1816, at Coppet.</p>

<p>"In behalf of my 'ten thousand' living brethren, and of myself, I
have thus far taken notice of an opinion expressed with regard to
'English poetry' in general, and which merited notice, because it
was YOURS.</p>

<p>"My principal object in addressing you was to testify my sincere
respect and admiration of a man, who, for half a century, has led
the literature of a great nation, and will go down to posterity as
the first literary character of his age.</p>

<p>"You have been fortunate, Sir, not only in the writings which have
illustrated your name, but in the name itself, as being
sufficiently musical for the articulation of posterity. In this you
have the advantage of some of your countrymen, whose names would
perhaps be immortal also&mdash;if any body could pronounce them.</p>

<p>"It may, perhaps, be supposed, by this apparent tone of levity,
that I am wanting in intentional respect towards you; but this will
be a mistake: I am always flippant in prose. Considering you, as I
really and warmly do, in common with all your own, and with most
other nations, to be by far the first literary character which has
existed in Europe since the death of Voltaire, I felt, and feel,
desirous to inscribe to you the following work,&mdash;<i>not</i> as being
either a tragedy or a <i>poem</i>, (for I cannot pronounce upon its
pretensions to be either one or the other,<span class="pagenum"><a id="page359" name="page359"></a>Pg 359</span> or both, or neither,)
but as a mark of esteem and admiration from a foreigner to the man
who has been hailed in Germany 'THE GREAT GOETHE.'</p>

<p>"I have the honour to be,</p>

<p>"With the truest respect,</p>

<p>"Your most obedient and</p>

<p>"Very humble servant,</p>

<p>"BYRON.</p>

<p>"Ravenna, 8bre 14&deg;, 1820.</p>

<p>"P.S. I perceive that in Germany, as well as in Italy, there is a
great struggle about what they call '<i>Classical</i>' and
'<i>Romantic</i>,'&mdash;terms which were not subjects of classification in
England, at least when I left it four or five years ago. Some of
the English scribblers, it is true, abused Pope and Swift, but the
reason was that they themselves did not know how to write either
prose or verse; but nobody thought them worth making a sect of.
Perhaps there may be something of the kind sprung up lately, but I
have not heard much about it, and it would be such bad taste that I
shall be very sorry to believe it."</p></div>

to do, adding, that if an attempt were made to take them by force, he
would shoot them through the head in the middle of the road, rather than
submit to such an act of tyranny upon a foreigner who was merely a
temporary resident in the country. Whether his answer was ever reported

to Mr. Murray, in which he denounces, as false and worthless, the
poetical system on which the greater number of his contemporaries, as
well as himself, founded their reputation, I took an opportunity, in the
next letter I wrote to him, of jesting a little on this opinion, and his
motives for it. It was, no doubt (I ventured to say), excellent policy
in him, who had made sure of his own immortality in this style of
writing, thus to <i>throw overboard</i> all <i>us poor devils</i>, who were
embarked with him. He was, in fact, I added, behaving towards us much in
the manner of the methodist preacher who said to his congregation&mdash;"You

skirts; but I'll cheat you all, for I'll wear a spencer, I'll wear a

William Rizzo, Lord Byron wrote the four following lines, which are in
no other respect remarkable than that they were thought worthy of being
metrically translated into no less than ten different languages; namely,
Greek, Latin, Italian (also in the Venetian dialect), German, French,
Spanish, Illyrian, Hebrew, Armenian, and Samaritan:&mdash;

<p>
The original lines, with the different versions just mentioned, were

expect to make by his manuscript was two hundred francs, Lord Byron
offered him that sum, if he would desist from publishing. The Italian,
however, held out for more; nor could he be brought to terms, till it
was intimated to him pretty plainly from Lord Byron that, should the
publication be persisted in, he would horsewhip him the very first time
they met. Being but little inclined to suffer martyrdom in the cause,
the translator accepted the two hundred francs, and delivered up his
manuscript, entering at the same time into a written engagement never to
translate any other of the noble poet's works.
</p><p>
Of the qualifications of this person as a translator of English poetry,
some idea may be formed from the difficulty he found himself under
respecting the meaning of a line in the Incantation in Manfred,&mdash;"And
the wisp on the morass,"&mdash;which he requested of Mr. Hoppner to expound
to him, not having been able to find in the dictionaries to which he had
access any other signification of the word "wisp" than "a bundle of
straw."</p></div>

friend at this time.
</p>
<div class="blockquot"><p>"Venice, August, 1818.
</p><p>
"We came from Padua hither in a gondola; and the gondolier, among
other things, without any hint on our part, began talking of Lord
Byron. He said he was a 'Giovanotto Inglese,' with a 'nome
stravagante,' who lived very luxuriously, and spent great sums of
money.
</p><p>
"At three o'clock I called on Lord Byron. He was delighted to see
me, and our first conversation of course consisted in the object of
our visit. He took me in his gondola, across the Laguna, to a long,
strandy sand, which defends Venice from the Adriatic. When we
disembarked, we found his horses waiting for us, and we rode along
the sands, talking. Our conversation consisted in histories of his
own wounded feelings, and questions as to my affairs, with great
professions of friendship and regard for me. He said that if he had
been in England, at the time of the Chancery affair, he would have
moved heaven and earth to have prevented such a decision. He talked
of literary matters,&mdash;his fourth Canto, which he says is very good,
and indeed repeated some stanzas, of great energy, to me. When we
returned to his palace, which is one if the most magnificent in
Venice," &amp;c. &amp;c.</p></div>
</div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_24_24" id="Footnote_24_24"></a><a href="#FNanchor_24_24"><span class="label">[24]</span></a> In the preface also to this poem, under the fictitious
name of Count Maddalo, the following just and striking portrait of Lord
Byron is drawn:&mdash;
</p><p>
"He is a person of the most consummate genius, and capable, if he would
direct his energies to such an end, of becoming the redeemer of his
degraded country. But it is his weakness to be proud: he derives, from a
comparison of his own extraordinary mind with the dwarfish intellects
that surround him, an intense apprehension of the nothingness of human
life. His passions and his powers are incomparably greater than those of
other men, and instead of the latter having been employed in curbing the
former, they have mutually lent each other strength. His ambition preys
upon itself for want of objects which it can consider worthy of
exertion. I say that Maddalo is proud, because I can find no other word
to express the concentred and impatient feelings which consume him; but
it is on his own hopes and affections only that he seems to trample, for
in social life no human being can be more gentle, patient, and
unassuming than Maddalo. He is cheerful, frank, and witty. His more
serious conversation is a sort of intoxication. He has travelled much;
and there is an inexpressible charm in his relation of his adventures in
different countries."</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_25_25" id="Footnote_25_25"></a><a href="#FNanchor_25_25"><span class="label">[25]</span></a> Deeply is it, for many reasons, to be regretted that this
friendly purpose did not succeed.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_26_26" id="Footnote_26_26"></a><a href="#FNanchor_26_26"><span class="label">[26]</span></a> This little child had been sent to him by its mother about
four or five months before, under the care of a Swiss nurse, a young
girl not above nineteen or twenty years of age, and in every respect
unfit to have the charge of such an infant, without the superintendence
of some more experienced person. "The child, accordingly," says my
informant, "was but ill taken care of;&mdash;not that any blame could attach
to Lord Byron, for he always expressed himself most anxious for her
welfare, but because the nurse wanted the necessary experience. The poor
girl was equally to be pitied; for, as Lord Byron's household consisted
of English and Italian men servants, with whom she could hold no
converse, and as there was no other female to consult with and assist
her in her charge, nothing could be more forlorn than her situation
proved to be."
</p><p>
Soon after the date of the above letter, Mrs. Hoppner, the lady of the
Consul General, who had, from the first, in compassion both to father
and child, invited the little Allegra occasionally to her house, very
kindly proposed to Lord Byron to take charge of her altogether, and an
arrangement was accordingly concluded upon for that purpose.</p></div>

as follows:&mdash;
</p><p>
"It appears that one evening Lord B., Mr. P.B. Shelley, two ladies, and
the gentleman before alluded to, after having perused a German work
called Phantasmagoria, began relating ghost stories, when his Lordship
having recited the beginning of Christabel, then unpublished, the whole
took so strong a hold of Mr. Shelley's mind, that he suddenly started
up, and ran out of the room. The physician and Lord Byron followed, and
discovered him leaning against a mantel-piece, with cold drops of
perspiration trickling down his face. After having given him something
to refresh him, upon enquiring into the cause of his alarm, they found
that his wild imagination having pictured to him the bosom of one of the
ladies with eyes (which was reported of a lady in the neighbourhood
where he lived), he was obliged to leave the room in order to destroy
the impression."</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_34_34" id="Footnote_34_34"></a><a href="#FNanchor_34_34"><span class="label">[34]</span></a> Though Lord Byron, like most other persons, in writing to
different friends, was sometimes led to repeat the same circumstances
and thoughts, there is, from the ever ready fertility of his mind, much
less of such repetition in his correspondence than in that, perhaps, of
any other multifarious letter-writer; and, in the instance before us,
where the same facts and reflections are, for the second time,
introduced, it is with such new touches, both of thought and expression,
as render them, even a second time, interesting;&mdash;what is wanting in the
novelty of the matter being made up by the new aspect given to it.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_35_35" id="Footnote_35_35"></a><a href="#FNanchor_35_35"><span class="label">[35]</span></a> There were, in the former edition, both here and in a
subsequent letter, some passages reflecting upon the late Sir Samuel
Romilly, which, in my anxiety to lay open the workings of Lord Byron's
mind upon a subject in which so much of his happiness and character were
involved, I had been induced to retain, though aware of the erroneous
impression under which they were written;&mdash;the evident morbidness of the
feeling that dictated the attack, and the high, stainless reputation of
the person assailed, being sufficient, I thought, to neutralise any ill
effects such reflections might otherwise have produced. As I find it,
however, to be the opinion of all those whose opinions I most respect,
that, even with these antidotes, such an attack upon such a man ought
not to be left on record, I willingly expunge all trace of it from these

Corpus Domini, mentre io attaccata da una malattia de consunzione ch'
ebbe principio dalla mia partenza da Venezia ero vicina a morire.
L'arrivo in Ravenna d'un forestiero distinto, in un paese cos&igrave; lontano
dalle strade che ordinariamente tengono i viaggiatori era un avvenimento
del quale molto si parlava, indagandosene i motivi, che
involontariamente poi egli feci conoscere. Perch&egrave; avendo egli domandato
di me per venire a vedermi ed essendogli risposto 'che non potrebbe
vedermi pi&ugrave; perch&egrave; ero vicina a morire'&mdash;egli rispose che in quel caso
voleva morire egli pure; la qual cosa essendosi poi ripetata si conobbe
cosi l'oggetto del suo viaggio.

"Il Conte Guiccioli visit&ograve; Lord Byron, essendolo conosciuto in Venezia,
e nella speranza che la di lui compagnia potesse distrarmi ed essermi di
qualche giovamento nello stato in cui mi trovavo egli lo invit&ograve; di
venire a visitarmi. Il giorno appresso egli venne. Non si potrebbero
descrivere le cure, i pensieri delicati, quanto egli fece per me. Per
molto tempo egli non ebbe per le mani che dei Libri di Medicina; e poco
confidandosi nel miei medici ottenne dal Conte Guiccioli il permesso di
far venire un valente medico di lui amico nel quale egli aveva molta
confidenza. Le cure del Professore Aglietti (cosi si chiama questo
distinto Italiano) la tranquillit&agrave;, anzi la felicit&agrave; inesprimibile che
mi cagionava la presenza di Lord Byron migliorarono cos&igrave; rapidamente la
mia salute che entro lo spazio di due mesi potei seguire mio marito in
un giro che egli doveva fare per le sue terre."&mdash;MS.</p></div>

never was absent from me. Being deprived at that time of his books, his
horses, and all that occupied him at Venice, I begged him to gratify me
by writing something on the subject of Dante, and, with his usual
facility and rapidity, he composed his 'Prophecy.'"&mdash;"Durante la mia

dramatist. Lord Byron took a strong interest in the representation, and
it was evident that he was deeply affected. At length there came a point
of the performance at which he could no longer restrain his
emotions;&mdash;he burst into a flood of tears, and, his sobs preventing him
from remaining any longer in the box, he rose and left the theatre.&mdash;I
saw him similarly affected another time during a representation of
Alfieri's 'Philip,' at Ravenna."&mdash;"Gli attori, e specialmente l' attrice
che rappresentava Mirra secondava assai bene la mente del nostro grande

Richardson, who admired both Milton and the Arts too warmly to make such
an admission upon any but valid grounds. "He does not appear," says this
writer, "to have much regarded what was done with the pencil; no, not
even when in Italy, in Rome, in the Vatican. Neither does it seem
Sculpture was much esteemed by him." After an authority like this, the
theories of Hayley and others, with respect to the impressions left upon
Milton's mind by the works of art he had seen in Italy, are hardly worth
a thought. Though it may be conceded that Dante was an admirer of the
Arts, his recommendation of the Apocalypse to Giotto, as a source of
subjects for the pencil, shows, at least, what indifferent judges poets
are, in general, of the sort of fancies fittest to be embodied by the
painter.</p></div>

perhaps, communicated to my readers through the medium of the following
extract from a letter which Mr. Barry (the friend and banker of Lord
Byron) did me the favour of addressing to me, soon after his Lordship's
death:&mdash;"When Lord Byron went to Greece, he gave me orders to advance
money to Madame G * *; but that lady would never consent to receive any.
His Lordship had also told me that he meant to leave his will in my
hands, and that there would be a bequest in it of 10,000<i>l.</i> to Madame G
* *. He mentioned this circumstance also to Lord Blessington. When the
melancholy news of his death reached me, I took for granted that this
will would be found among the sealed papers he had left with me; but
there was no such instrument. I immediately then wrote to Madame G * *,
enquiring if she knew any thing concerning it, and mentioning, at the
same time, what his Lordship had said is to the legacy. To this the lady
replied, that he had frequently spoken to her on the same subject, but
that she had always cut the conversation short, as it was a topic she by
no means liked to hear him speak upon. In addition, she expressed a wish
that no such will as I had mentioned would be found; as her
circumstances were already sufficiently independent, and the world might
put a wrong construction on her attachment, should it appear that her
fortunes were, in any degree, bettered by it."</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_54_54" id="Footnote_54_54"></a><a href="#FNanchor_54_54"><span class="label">[54]</span></a> Between Wieland, the author of this Romance, and Lord
Byron, may be observed some of those generic points of resemblance which
it is so interesting to trace in the characters of men of genius. The
German poet, it is said, never perused any work that made a strong
impression upon him, without being stimulated to commence one, himself,
on the same topic and plan; and in Lord Byron the imitative principle
was almost equally active,&mdash;there being few of his poems that might not,
in the same manner, be traced to the strong impulse given to his
imagination by the perusal of some work that had just before interested
him. In the history, too, of their lives and feelings, there was a
strange and painful coincidence,&mdash;the revolution that took place in all
Wieland's opinions, from the Platonism and romance of his youthful days,
to the material and Epicurean doctrines that pervaded all his maturer
works, being chiefly, it is supposed, brought about by the shock his
heart had received from a disappointment of its affections in early
life. Speaking of the illusion of this first passion, in one of his
letters, he says,&mdash;"It is one for which no joys, no honours, no gifts of
fortune, not even wisdom itself can afford an equivalent, and which,
when it has once vanished, returns no more."</p></div>

Switzerland, had, with all the zeal of a true friend, written a letter
to Lord Byron, entreating him "to leave Ravenna while yet he had a whole
skin, and urging him not to risk the safety of a person he appeared so
sincerely attached to&mdash;as well as his own&mdash;for the gratification of a
momentary passion, which could only be a source of regret to both
parties." In the same letter Mr. Hoppner informed him of some reports he
had heard lately at Venice, which, though possibly, he said, unfounded,
had much increased his anxiety respecting the consequences of the
connection formed by him.</p></div>

he was rather apt thus to express the feelings of the moment, without
troubling himself to consider how soon he might be induced to change
them. He was at this time so sensitive on the subject of Madame * *,
that, merely because some persons had disapproved of her conduct, he
declaimed in the above manner against the whole nation. I never"
(continues Mr. Hoppner) "was partial to Venice; but disliked it almost
from the first month of my residence there. Yet I experienced more
kindness in that place than I ever met with in any country, and
witnessed acts of generosity and disinterestedness such as rarely are

given by Madame Guiccioli:&mdash;"At the beginning of winter Count Guiccioli
came from Ravenna to fetch me. When he arrived, Lord Byron was ill of a
fever, occasioned by his having got wet through;&mdash;a violent storm having
surprised him while taking his usual exercise on horseback. He had been
delirious the whole night, and I had watched continually by his bedside.
During his delirium he composed a good many verses, and ordered his
servant to write them down from his dictation. The rhythm of these
verses was quite correct, and the poetry itself had no appearance of
being the work of a delirious mind. He preserved them for some time
after he got well, and then burned them."&mdash;"Sul cominciare dell' inverno
il Conte Guiccioli venne a prendermi per ricondurmi a Ravenna. Quando
egli giunse Ld. Byron era ammalato di febbri prese per essersi bagnato
avendolo sorpreso un forte temporale mentre faceva l' usato suo
esercizio a cavallo. Egli aveva delirato tutta la notte, ed io aveva
sempre vegliato presso al suo letto. Nel suo delirio egli compose molti
versi che ordin&ograve; al suo domestico di scrivere sotto la sua dittatura. La
misura dei versi era esatissima, e la poesia pure non pareva opera di
una mente in delirio. Egli la conserv&ograve; lungo tempo dopo restabilito&mdash;poi
l' abbrucci&ograve;."
</p><p>
I have been informed, too, that, during his ravings at this time, he was
constantly haunted by the idea of his mother-in-law,&mdash;taking every one
that came near him for her, and reproaching those about him for letting
her enter his room.</p></div>

mistaken the object of her application to him, which was to request
that, by allowing her to have the sheets of some of his works before
publication, he would enable her to prepare early translations for the
French booksellers, and thus afford her the means of acquiring something

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.net/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.net

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.net),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
